Participation is voluntary

It is your choice whether or not to participate in this research. If you choose to participate, you may change your mind and leave the study at any time. Refusal to participate or stopping your participation will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.



What is the purpose of this research? 

The purpose of this research is to examine human judgments about automated vehicles. All data from this experiment are gathered for scientific purposes and will contribute to our eventual understanding of brain and visual function. These data may be published in scientific journals so that other researchers may have access to these data.



How long will I take part in this research? 

Your participation will take approximately 5-10 minutes to complete.



What can I expect if I take part in this research? 

As a participant, you will be asked to look at images presented on a video display and give responses with key presses or movements of a mouse pointing device. Your response may involve responding as quickly as you can, memorizing what you saw, making a judgment, or completing a questionnaire. You will also be asked to complete a demographics form.



What are the risks and possible discomforts? 

If you choose to participate, the effects should be comparable to those you would experience from viewing a computer monitor for 15 minutes and using a mouse or keyboard, e.g., eye fatigue. You are free to take breaks throughout the session. 



Will I be compensated for participating in this research? 

You will be compensated $1.00 for this study. You will still receive payment if you withdraw early.



If I take part in this research, how will my privacy be protected? What happens to the information you collect? 

Your participation in this experiment will remain confidential, and your identity will not be stored with your data.

Yes, there will always be the risk of problems, but this risk is unacceptable in the field of automotive manufacture as defects have the potential to cause damage and even cost lives.

That being said...the human driver should not have been on the phone and should have been attentive to the road.  These tools are intended to increase safety by making up for minor mistakes, not something to be relied on as a crutch for bad driving decisions.

In short; I think Aeon holds more responsibility overall but the human driver also needs to acknowledge their part in the accident.","1","4","Non-Binary","6","Swedish/Hispanic","28","3","","2","5","5f5bd4eee8768816413c0cb5"

AI, even with the best, newest, and shiniest upgrades, does not take away the fact that it's still only a tool. It has no remorse, consciousness, or free will. In essence, we strapped our laptops into the driver's seat and gave them gas money.  For these reasons, we are responsible for whatever befalls the vehicle while we are in it, regardless of who might be driving.

In terms of who is financially liable for the accident, I feel like Aeon should bear the brunt of those costs because they are the ones who brought this product to market. Even if they experiment with the technology for decades, stuff happens. I came to you and bought this product, trusting that you had done your due diligence on the product through rigorous testing.  I put my trust and money into this company. I was sold on the belief that this would be a reliable, trustworthy self-driver. The fact that it completely blew through a stop sign is beyond acceptable. So, I believe Aeon is financially responsible because they made and marketed the product that then failed in it's duty. I don't feel like the human should be responsible for an AI error because they did not create or manufacture the product. If my roomba sparks out and catches on fire, I don't blame it on the cat.","2","","","","","","","","","","2","","3","","52","8","currently attending university full-time, sophomore undergrad","1","3","5c8570c3bce73c00178c4dc6"

I believe that Aeon, the company that developed the self-driving car, is more liable for the accident because the car was under their control and they are responsible for its safety. However, the human driver may also be held partially liable if they were negligent in any way, such as by not paying attention to the road or by overriding the car's autonomous driving system.

Ultimately, the courts will decide who is liable for the accident based on the specific facts of the case.
