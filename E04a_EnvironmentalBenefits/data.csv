Participation is voluntary

It is your choice whether or not to participate in this research. If you choose to participate, you may change your mind and leave the study at any time. Refusal to participate or stopping your participation will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.



What is the purpose of this research? 

The purpose of this research is to examine human judgments about automated vehicles. All data from this experiment are gathered for scientific purposes and will contribute to our eventual understanding of brain and visual function. These data may be published in scientific journals so that other researchers may have access to these data.



How long will I take part in this research? 

Your participation will take approximately 5-10 minutes to complete.



What can I expect if I take part in this research? 

As a participant, you will be asked to look at images presented on a video display and give responses with key presses or movements of a mouse pointing device. Your response may involve responding as quickly as you can, memorizing what you saw, making a judgment, or completing a questionnaire. You will also be asked to complete a demographics form.



What are the risks and possible discomforts? 

If you choose to participate, the effects should be comparable to those you would experience from viewing a computer monitor for 15 minutes and using a mouse or keyboard, e.g., eye fatigue. You are free to take breaks throughout the session. 



Will I be compensated for participating in this research? 

You will be compensated $1.00 for this study. You will still receive payment if you withdraw early.



If I take part in this research, how will my privacy be protected? What happens to the information you collect? 

Your participation in this experiment will remain confidential, and your identity will not be stored with your data.

Basic autopilot features *should* react to stop signs (and traffic lights) under all conditions, yet this one clearly did not. Also, if he's letting the autopilot drive him  home from work, we can assume it's probably done this before - all the more reason it should know the road. The driver appears to have thought the autopilot could handle this situation, so they may not have been at fault even for glancing at their phone, although they certainly would be if it was not an autopilot car. In this case, I'd say Aeon is considerably more responsible.","2","","","","","","","","","","2","","3","","69","4","","1","68","5de7d10810088f749c347bb6"

So I think they are both liable and responsible.  I think the human driver is slightly less responsible because I think they had confidence in the automated system which is why they briefly checked the text message, and the company/Aeon system is a little more at fault because not noticing and stopping at a stop sign is a pretty major failure for an automated driving system.","1","2","","3","","50","4","","1","0","5fdbdc853ce8060db67cf718"

Many people can sit and watch television and be alert. If the TV suddenly turns off, they can turn it on.  Reframe your marketing to assisted driving and remove any misunderstandings that the car can completely drive itself without issues, and you should be okay.

Though it is cool, CoPilot should probably not be on the road in general if failures like this are so easily possible with something as simple as stopping at a stop sign. Ultimately, CoPilot is more liable for the system's failure as they mislead others into believing it is a safe option.","1","2","","3","","27","4","","1","27","5cc1ffc2f6ef910019e51145"
