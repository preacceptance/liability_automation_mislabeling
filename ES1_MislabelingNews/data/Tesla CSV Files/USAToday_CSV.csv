All Rights Reserved.","  In what Northern California first responders are calling a miracle, four people survived an incredible single-vehicle crash after a Tesla dove off a cliff along the Pacific Coast Highway Monday morning.  A 4-year-old girl, a 9-year-old boy and two adults suffered serious injuries after the sedan they were riding in plunged hundreds of feet off a cliff along State Route 1 near Devil's Slide – an area known for fatal wrecks, officials with Coastside Fire Protection District/Cal Fire reported. ","  The vehicle apparently flipped a few times before landing on its wheels, wedged against the cliff just feet from the surf, Brian Pottenger, a battalion chief with the agency, said at the scene.  On Monday afternoon, Cal Fire San Mateo's Santa Cruz Unit shared a video letting drivers in the area know that the car went over the cliff and there would be delays along the coastal roadway.  The victims were initially listed in critical condition but all four were conscious and alert when rescuers arrived.  The Tesla plummeted more than 250 feet from the highway and crashed into a rocky outcropping, officials said. Pottenger said the vehicle flipped several times before landing on its wheels, wedged against the cliff just feet from the surf.  Neither CAL Fire nor the California Highway Patrol could immediately be reached for comment by USA TODAY Tuesday morning for an update on the victims' conditions.  Officials did not provide the victims' names or say where they are from.  Crashes along Devil's Slide, a steep, rocky and winding coastal area about 20 miles south of San Francisco between Pacifica and Montara, rarely end with survivors.  ""We go there all the time for cars over the cliff and they never live. This was an absolute miracle,"" Pottenger said.  Watching through binoculars  Pottenger said witnesses called 911 at 10:15 a.m. and responding crews set up a rope system from the highway to lower firefighters down the cliff.  At the same time, he said, other firefighters watching the sedan through binoculars noticed movement – a sign that at least one person was still alive.  ""Every one of us was shocked when we saw movement out of the front windshield,"" Pottenger said.  The incident turned from what had been likely a recovery of bodies to a rescue operation that took several hours amid constant rain, heavy winds, slick roads and crashing waves. The doors were smashed against the cliff and jammed shut, so firefighters were forced to cut the victims out of the car using the so-called ""jaws of life"" tools.  Crews pulled the two children out of the Tesla's back window and brought them up the cliff in a basket using a rope. They were rushed to the hospital by ambulance to be treated for musculoskeletal injuries, officials reported.  Based on the California Highway Patrol's initial investigation, troopers do not believe the Tesla was operating in Autopilot or Full Self-Driving mode at the time, Officer Mark Andrews said.  The road's conditions also were not believed to be a factor in the crash. There was no guardrail at the spot where the sedan went off the cliff.  ""The car traveled off the main portion of the roadway. For what reason, we don't know,"" Andrews said.

All Rights Reserved.","  U.S. auto safety regulators launched an investigation into Tesla's partially self-driving car system after nearly a dozen reports of the company's vehicles crashing into cars at the scenes of incidents involving emergency responders.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened the probe Friday into Tesla's Autopilot, which steers, brakes and accelerates the vehicle on most roads with lanes. ","  Though the system can drive the vehicle on its own in many circumstances, drivers are supposed to keep their hands on the wheel in case they need to take over when Autopilot encounters a situation that's too complex for it to handle on its own.  The National Transportation Safety Board and NHTSA have investigated Autopilot multiple times, including after a crash in 2016 that killed a man in Florida who authorities said had too much confidence in the system's capabilities. Safety watchdogs have criticized Tesla for exaggerating Autopilot's functions, but Tesla CEO Elon Musk argued that the system is safer than human drivers.  In May, a deadly crash in Texas involving an Autopilot vehicle called attention to the fact that drivers can trick Autopilot into thinking someone's behind the wheel even if no one is.  Tesla owners have posted photos to YouTube showing themselves abusing the technology by riding in the back seat while the vehicle drives itself.  Soon after the Texas incident, Tesla announced it was activating cameras to monitor whether drivers are paying attention to the road while using Autopilot.  In the newest probe, NHTSA investigators identified 11 crashes since January 2018 ""in which Tesla models of various configurations have encountered first responder scenes and subsequently struck one or more vehicles involved with those scenes,"" according to an Office of Defects Investigation document. ""Most incidents took place after dark and the crash scenes encountered included scene control measures such as first responder vehicle lights, flares, an illuminated arrow board, and road cones. The involved subject vehicles were all confirmed to have been engaged in either Autopilot or Traffic Aware Cruise Control during the approach to the crashes.""  Tesla did not respond to a request seeking comment. The company eliminated its media relations department in the past year.

All Rights Reserved.","  Tesla owners who want to tap into a self-driving feature when traveling local streets got a boost this weekend, when the electric car maker began releasing a much-anticipated software update, reports say.  The updates to the Full Self-Driving beta version 9 became available Saturday according to tech publication The Verge, and Electrek, a news site dedicated to reports about Tesla and other electric vehicles. ","  The update expands assisted driving capabilities for a small pool of Tesla owners who get to try out features early, according to Electrek.  Tesla's assisted driving programs have come under scrutiny in the wake of several accidents involving Teslas, including some that were in Autopilot mode.  Since those incidents, federal transportation officials have said Tesla has done an inadequate job of monitoring drivers to make sure they are engaged and also has permitted the Autopilot feature to be used on roads where it's not suitable.  The car maker appeared to address some of those concerns in notes connected to the release of the software update, warning drivers to use the Full Self-Driving feature ""only if you will pay constant attention to the road and be prepared to act immediately, especially around blind corners, crossing intersections and in narrow driving situations,"" according to Electrek.  Tesla also reportedly began activating the in-car camera in its vehicles in May to keep track of attentiveness when drivers use the partially self-driving technology.  The new software update has been touted for the past three years with Elon Musk, Tesla's founder, repeatedly saying it was on its way, reports say.   CO 	 teslmi : Tesla, Inc.

Then, you drive your rental car where you want and once you arrive, you exit the vehicle and it takes off on its own.  Later this year, Las Vegas will be the testing ground for a pilot program sending driverless EVs, driven by a remote pilot, to customers who order a car via a mobile app. When the car arrives, the driver gets in and drives to his destination. After the rental driver leaves, the remote driver directs the EV to its next location. ","  Autonomous and driverless car technology company Halo plans to make the service available initially in urban parts of the Las Vegas Valley. Remote drivers have a 360-degree video view – just as if they were in the car – and additional sensors eliminate blind spots. Video and data are sent via T-Mobile's 5G network, the provider and Halo announced Thursday.  ""You push a button and summon an electric car. It just comes to your doorstep,"" Anand Nandakumar, the founder and CEO of Halo, told USA TODAY. ""You hop in and you drive the car to your destination and once you are done, hop off and walk away and the car just disappears.""  5G behind driverless 'magic'  T-Mobile, which launched its consumer 5G network last year, also in 2020 co-founded the 5G Open Innovation Lab along with several other tech companies including Dell, Intel and Microsoft. Halo has been in stealth mode for two years.  Despite the potential benefits of 5G connectivity including faster data speeds on smartphones and a growing network of internet-connected devices, there's not many real-world examples of how 5G can change things. Halo's remote-piloted cars could change that.  ""So many industries are already being transformed today by 5G, and it's the startups and entrepreneurs – developers like Halo – that are making the magic happen,"" said T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert in a statement to USA TODAY. ""True, nationwide 5G is powering groundbreaking new products and services that will change nearly every facet of our world, connecting people and things at massive scale.""  Originally based in the San Francisco Bay Area, Halo began testing remote control of EVs in California in August 2020. In February, the company moved its testing to Las Vegas, where Halo is now headquartered.  In addition to remote drivers piloting the Kia Niro crossover SUVs from Halo's mission control, Halo equips the vehicles with an artificial intelligence-driven ""Advanced Safe Stop mechanism"" that automatically brings the cars to a full stop when there's a potential safety hazard, the company said.  Risks in self-driving car tests  The development of self-driving cars has been underway for more than four years with big tech names such as Amazon, Apple and Google's parent company Alphabet involved, along with Tesla, Ford, GM and other auto makers.  But there have been setbacks such as the April crash of a Tesla in the Houston area that killed two passengers. In that case, the National Transportation Safety Board said in a preliminary report the driver had been behind the wheel but came to no conclusions about the crash's cause. Tesla says on its website that drivers are supposed to keep their hands on the wheel at all times, ready to take over when the semi-autonomous system is not able to steer, accelerate or brake on its own.  Uber sold its self-driving division last year to Aurora, a startup headed by Chris Urmson, who had led Google's autonomous vehicle efforts. That came after a self-driving Uber vehicle, with a backup operator in the driver's seat, fatally hit a 49-year-old woman in Tempe, Arizona, in March 2018. (Uber invested $400 million in Aurora, which is backed by Amazon, and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi joined the startup's board.  Las Vegas has been a hotspot for the testing of self-driving vehicles with demonstrations held during the Consumer Electronics Show beginning in January 2017. Between May 2018 and February 2020 in Las Vegas, Lyft and autonomous tech company Aptiv delivered more than 100,000 robotaxi self-driving rides, with a human driver sitting in the driver's seat. Lyft sold its self-driving unit in April to Woven Planet Holdings for about $550 million.  Halo's program seeks to build trust in autonomous vehicles, as well as increase the use of electric cars, Nandakumar said. ""Consumers never get an opportunity to actually see an autonomous car deployed on public roads. They never get a chance to interact with it or take rides with it,"" he said.  Pricing has not been announced, but Halo rides will be ""highly affordable for everyone,"" the companies said.  Beyond that, Halo's service seeks to solve the problem of ""the last mile between your last transit stop and your workplace or your home,"" said John Saw, executive vice president of advanced and emerging tech at T-Mobile. ""It helps us show the world, hey, we are not just talking about it but we are showing what we can do with 5G.""

All Rights Reserved.","  The perception that self-driving cars can really operate themselves without driver involvement is worrying automotive watchdogs, who say that some Americans have grown dangerously confident in the capabilities of semi-autonomous vehicles.  Their comments come as electric vehicle maker Tesla's so-called Autopilot system is under scrutiny once again following a crash that killed two passengers in the Houston area late Saturday. ","  ""I would start by saying there are no self-driving cars despite what you may read about or what you've seen advertised,"" said Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing for Consumer Reports. ""And there's certainly nothing anywhere close to self-driving that is in production right now.""  Tesla has been the most common target of critics for marketing that its vehicles are capable of ""full self-driving"" with an upgrade. They are not capable of full self-driving – and, in fact, Tesla says on its website that drivers are supposed to keep their hands on the wheel at all times, ready to take over when the system is not able to steer, accelerate or brake on its own.  In general, the most advanced available technology in new cars from Tesla, General Motors and Mercedes-Benz is capable of steering, accelerating and braking in certain circumstances, but their ability remains limited and drivers are supposed to continuously pay attention to the road.  Some drivers have found ways around Autopilot's restrictions, including the use of ""Autopilot Buddy,"" a now-illegal aftermarket that tricked the vehicle into thinking the driver's hands were on the wheel. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued a cease-and-desist order to that device's manufacturer in June 2018.  It was not immediately clear whether Autopilot was engaged in the latest Tesla crash. But Harris County Precinct 4 Constable Mark Herman told The Wall Street Journal that investigators are ""99.9% sure"" that ""there was no one at the wheel"" when the crash happened.  ""Autopilot is an intentionally deceptive name being used for a set of features that are essentially an advanced cruise control system,"" said Jason Levine, director of the Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit Center for Auto Safety. ""There really is no longer a question that Tesla's marketing is leading consumers to foreseeably misuse the technology in a dangerous way.""  NHTSA said Monday that it is investigating the incident.  ""NHTSA has immediately launched a Special Crash Investigation team to investigate the crash,"" the agency said in a statement. ""We are actively engaged with local law enforcement and Tesla to learn more about the details of the crash and will take appropriate steps when we have more information.""  Tesla did not respond to an emailed request seeking comment for this story.  On Saturday, before news of the crash broke, CEO Elon Musk's Twitter account cited a report claiming that cars with its Autopilot system engaged ""are now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle.""  On Monday, after reports about the crash circulated, Musk said on Twitter that ""data logs recovered so far show Autopilot was not enabled & this car did not purchase FSD,"" referring to ""full self-driving"" capability. That could not be independently verified.  ""Moreover, standard Autopilot would require lane lines to turn on, which this street did not have,"" he said.  Tesla is among many tech companies and automakers that are developing self-driving cars, including Waymo, General Motors, Volkswagen and Ford. Apple is reportedly doing the same.  Automotive watchdogs acknowledge that the development of self-driving car technology will likely be reducing crashes and deaths on the road. More than 36,000 people were killed in the U.S. in crashes in 2019, according to NHTSA, which has endorsed the development of self-driving vehicles.  But self-driving cars currently under development are being tested in limited scenarios, such as fully mapped roads in Phoenix, San Francisco and Detroit.  ""Getting it right to the point where the driver doesn't need to be engaged is extremely challenging, and we're just not there yet,"" said Greg Brannon, director of automotive engineering for AAA.  Paradoxically, the better the system gets, the more misplaced faith drivers have in their capability, Brannon said.  Fisher of Consumer Reports said part of the problem is that Tesla's system ""can be engaged in areas where it is absolutely beyond its capability.""  In effect, that means Autopilot can be activated on roads that are too complicated for it to safely maneuver, he said.  Other automakers have taken a different approach with systems that partially automate driving in limited circumstances. GM has deployed a system called Super Cruise on Cadillac models, providing hands-free driving on fully mapped highways and freeways. The system uses a camera to track the driver's eye movement to ensure drivers are keeping their eyes on the road. If drivers take their eyes off the road for more than a few moments, the system alerts them to pay attention – and if they don't look at the road, it will bring the car to a stop.  ""There are systems that automate steering and automate speed that need constant monitoring from the driver,"" Fisher said. ""The driver is still driving the car even if some of the controls are automated.""  Even automakers that produce semi-autonomous cars offer what they call advanced driver assistance systems, including technology such as lane-keeping assistance, blind-spot monitoring and automatic emergency braking.  ""They're driver aids, and that's all,"" Fisher said. ""Assist is the keyword. If there are systems that assist the driver, that can absolutely be helpful. Give the driver more information, help the driver with certain tasks. Done correctly, they can absolutely improve safety and comfort for the driver.""  About 96% of 2020 model-year vehicles came with at least one advanced driver assistance systems feature, according to AAA.  Levine, of the Center for Auto Safety, said advanced driver assistance systems features ""could save far more lives, far more affordably and right away"" than systems like Tesla's Autopilot.  While some Americans appear to be too trusting of self-driving car technology, others don't trust it at all.  About 86% ""would be afraid to ride in a self-driving vehicle"" or ""are unsure about it,"" according to a recent AAA survey. Only 14% ""would trust riding in a vehicle that drives itself.""  In the short run, ""the real opportunity is to do a better job with basic safety systems that can really make a difference in reducing fatalities on the road,"" AAA's Brannon said.

All Rights Reserved.","  Vehicle owners could soon buy insurance directly from car companies that are promising lower rates to motorists who drive safely.  General Motors announced Wednesday that it is launching OnStar Insurance with plans to make it available to the public by early next year and go nationwide by the end of 2021. The name comes from the brand GM has long used on the safety-and-security communication system embedded in its vehicles. ","  Tesla recently began selling insurance to its vehicle owners in California with plans to expand to other states, and several other automakers have partnered with insurance companies to offer policies to their customers.  Yet GM is expected to sell its own insurance policies to all vehicles, including non-GM cars, trucks and SUVs, as well as homeowners and renters insurance, through its new agency, OnStar Insurance Services.  The automaker said it eventually will tie auto insurance rates directly to the consenting driver's performance based on driving data wirelessly collected from the vehicle, rather than educational history and other personal factors.  OnStar Insurance President Andrew Rose declined to provide an estimate for how much the average driver might save since it's dependent on so many variables, including the kind of car they drive, their road habits and their location. But he said the savings will be ""significant.""  The average American is expected to pay about $1,463 for insurance in 2020, according to policy comparison site Insurify.  ""You'll have the opportunity over time to have greater control over your pricing,"" Rose said. ""We know your vehicle better than anybody else and, if you consent, we will use your information on how you drive your vehicle to demonstrate that you're a better driver and thus lower your"" prices.  It could be hard to get Americans to switch. About 2 in 3 consumers don't shop around for a better deal when their policy is up for renewal, according to a survey by LendingTree. The older you get, the less likely you are to switch.  But the chance to save money could be a significant lure, especially during these tough economic times, said Andrew Hurst, who analyzes insurance trends for LendingTree.  ""Most people fancy themselves as pretty good drivers, so they're intrigued by the notion that they'll be rewarded for that,"" Hurst said.  To be sure, most major insurers and various upstarts already offer some form of policy that considers the policy holder's driving habits. But those policies typically require the driver to consent to providing that data through an onboard device.  ""They're able to track how you're driving, when you're driving, where you're driving,"" said Kyle Schmitt, vice president and global managing director of J.D. Power's insurance industry division. ""Are you braking hard? Are you using your phone while you're driving? They can now at least rudimentarily and, in many cases, quite sophisticatedly measure these types of things.""  Good drivers get lower rates. Bad drivers? Expect more conventional premiums.  ""If you behave poorly, you pretty much know where the ceiling is,"" Schmitt said.  Privacy concerns  A majority of drivers haven't yet opted in, according to industry experts. Many have been wary of handing over their data without getting something concrete in return.  ""For them to start making that trade-off, they need to start seeing some pretty substantial discounts,"" Schmitt said.  Rose said that the benefits of providing access to vehicle driving data will extend beyond savings. In the future, he said, GM will introduce technology that enables its vehicles to notify emergency responders and OnStar Insurance when an accident occurs so that the insurance claims process and repairs can begin quickly.  OnStar Insurance will be sold primarily through a website, though it will have call centers. Rose said GM would not place insurance agents in dealerships, though he said dealers could help car buyers obtain policies online.  Self-driving cars change game  The move to start an insurance agency harkens back to the days when GM was a sprawling company with wide-ranging products and services. The automaker sold insurance through its GMAC unit for several decades before running into financial troubles and selling off the division in 2008. GMAC rebranded as Ally.  More car companies will be attracted by the possibility of gaining additional revenue from insurance, but the ""biggest value"" is a ""deeper relationship with their customers,"" Insurify CEO Snejina Zacharia said.  ""People want to feel empowered that they're making the best decision for themselves,"" she said.  One X factor in the insurance business is the emergence of autonomous vehicle technology, including systems, like Tesla's Autopilot and GM's Super Cruise, that partially drive the vehicle on behalf of the motorist.  As self-driving car technology becomes a reality in years to come, some insurance industry experts believe that rates will fall sharply because there will be fewer crashes. That may mean less profit for insurers.  But Rose said ""there's going to be a need for auto insurance for a significant period of time,"" and when autonomous vehicles become a reality, ""you're still going to have tree branches that fall on cars.""  Launching an insurance business from scratch takes an investment in actuarial science, advertising and regulatory teams that can navigate the different insurance laws in the 50 states.  One advantage for automakers is that they are already spending heavily on advertising and could potentially begin appending their marketing with information on their insurance plans.  ""They have deep pockets,"" Schmitt said.

All Rights Reserved.","  No one was crossing Kercheval Avenue on The Hill in Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan, as a minivan made its way through the shopping district one evening this fall, but people were clearly nearby.  They could be seen there on the laptop screen from inside the vehicle, their presence confirmed by glowing images captured by a thermal camera. ","  But the pedestrians weren't on the street, and it took a moment to realize that they were actually on the sidewalk, obscured by decorative plantings and the darkness that coated everything not illuminated.  It wasn't a great night for spotting pedestrians on this particular weeknight on a drive through a couple of the Grosse Pointes and the east side of Detroit. Maybe the pandemic was keeping people inside. Those who were out, however, were not hard to see, at least on the screen.  The eyeball view through the windshield was a different story, with darkness providing an effective camouflage. And darkness can be deadly for pedestrians.  Most pedestrians who die in crashes are killed at night, but nighttime has been when the technology designed to prevent pedestrian crashes struggles most.  Last year, AAA revealed some startling deficiencies in driver assistance systems designed to protect pedestrians.  At night, several test vehicles equipped with automatic emergency braking systems and pedestrian detection were found to be ""completely ineffective."" Rather than bash the automakers' efforts, AAA encouraged continued development of systems because of the scope of the pedestrian death crisis in this country.  But finding a solution as the deaths of so many Americans on and along our roads has continued to rise – 6,283 men, women and children in 2018 alone, according to federal statistics – has become more urgent. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration even designated October as the first national Pedestrian Safety Month, an acknowledgment of the dangers faced by vulnerable road users. A 2018 Detroit Free Press/USA TODAY investigation highlighted the role the increase in large vehicles, such as SUVs, has played in the rising number of deaths.  Vehicle technology is one way to improve protection for pedestrians at night, and a couple of thermal imaging companies are promoting their systems as the answer. Thermal imaging already is having a bit of a moment this year in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thermal cameras can be used to detect elevated body temperatures at a distance. That allows them to function as an initial screening in such places as auto plants to monitor for people who could be feverish, a potential symptom of the virus.  Results of thermal testing in Michigan appear to show promise in the realm of pedestrian detection at night, too.  U.S.-based Flir Systems, along with VSI Labs, tested an automatic emergency braking system at the American Center for Mobility in Ypsilanti Township. The tests ""fused"" data from thermal sensing with radar, a nonthermal camera and a computer network. The test vehicle, a Ford Fusion equipped with Flir's system, managed to avoid heated targets designed to appear as a child or an adult in all but two tries out of more than two dozen. In the two cases where the car touched the targets, it did not knock them down.  In contrast, four other test vehicles not equipped with Flir's technology – a BMW X7, Subaru Forrester, Toyota Corolla and Tesla Model 3 – all failed in night testing by hitting the targets. They performed much better during daylight testing although only the X7 managed to get through each of those tests without hitting the target, according to Flir.  ""We were able to stop really successfully at night,"" explained Mike Walters, a Flir vice president.  He described the instances where the Flir-equipped Fusion made contact with the targets as a minor touch rather than a full hit, something that can be fixed with adjustments to the system in future testing.  That would be a far cry from what was seen in videos shown as part of AAA's testing, with a 2019 Chevrolet Malibu, Honda Accord, Tesla Model 3 and Toyota Camry plowing into targets in many cases.  Thermal cameras have been pitched as a way to help advanced driver assistance systems and someday actual self-driving systems ""see"" pedestrians and even deer on the roads. But it's the focus on nighttime applications, which is what Flir and Adasky, a competitor from Israel, are discussing. With three-quarters of fatal pedestrian deaths happening in nighttime crashes, systems that work well only during daylight hours would appear to have limited appeal.  The recent nighttime drive around Detroit's east side and the Grosse Pointes in a minivan equipped with Adasky's thermal camera showed the technology at work. The setup was not designed to brake for anyone crossing the road but instead to show via a laptop display what the camera can pick up. A reporter, who had been on a previous drive in daylight, could see clearly on the screen when people, even in dark clothing on a dark street, were nearby. In several cases, pedestrians and cyclists were very difficult to see with the naked eye, but their heat signature was visible on the screen. A couple of instances showed a slight delay in the image appearing, but the man behind the wheel, Bill Grabowski, head of Adasky, North America, said the system can be adjusted to account for that as well.  Most experts promote the idea of using several different types of sensors for automatic emergency braking systems. Thermal cameras can detect people and animals in conditions, such as at night and in the rain, that might be a challenge for other types of sensors.  ""It's going to fill the gap in the edge cases that all these other sensors can't hit,"" Grabowski said of cameras.  David Zuby, chief research officer at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, said thermal technology appears to offer promise, but his Virginia-based group has not yet been able to do a comparison.  However, Zuby said automakers will need to address nighttime driving conditions.  ""The infrared technology might be a good technology for achieving that,"" he said, noting that other combinations and better headlights could work.

A few years ago, those who kicked the tires on new vehicles might have prioritized fuel efficiency, comfort or horsepower. ","  Today, it's all about the tech.  ""The race never ends to develop 'must have' vehicle technologies,"" says Kristin Kolodge, executive director of driver interaction and human machine interface research at J.D. Power. ""New technology continues to be a primary factor in the vehicle purchase decision.""  Automotive expert Nik Miles echoes Kolodge's assessment: ""Besides price, tech plays a major role when considering a new car – interestingly, for every age group – but it has to be easy to use.""  Miles is founder and host of OurAutoExpert.com. ""Even inexpensive vehicles are loaded with tech, whether it's tech you see, such as cutting-edge infotainment systems, or tech you don't see that keeps drivers safe,"" Miles says.  The following is a quick look at a few promising teched-out vehicles this fall.  2021 Toyota Venza  Starting at $32,470, this new two-row crossover SUV features Toyota Safety Sense 2.5, a comprehensive suite of active safety systems that includes a pre-collision system with advanced pedestrian and bicyclist detection; road sign assist, which actively scans the sides of the road to detect select road signs and displays them on the dashboard; and emergency steering assist, which could help drivers avoid a pedestrian or other object.  The 2021 Toyota Venza features lane departure alert, lane tracing assist and dynamic cruise control.  In a first for the company, the vehicle supports an optional Star Gaze fixed panoramic moonroof. Similar to some airplanes that use this technology to block outside light, this is electrochromic glass that allows drivers to switch from transparent to frosted modes with the push of a button. This is a $1,400 option on the LTD grade of the vehicle (which includes a 12.3-inch touchscreen).  Ford Mustang Mach-E  Speaking of firsts, Ford is expanding its Mustang lineup for the first time in 55 years, with an all-electric model.  The Mach-E (from $44,995) is a four-door SUV that has similar hallmarks to the company's iconic muscle car – in its design and performance – and can go from 0 to 60 in about three and a half seconds for the GT Performance Edition package (about $60,000).  Aside from a ton of power and torque, this electric vehicle (EV) crossover has an estimated range of at least 300 miles, with the available extended-range battery and rear-wheel drive. It can route customers to nearby public charging stations and will provide access to more than 12,500 public charge stations in the FordPass network.  2021 Cadillac Escalade  When it comes to semiautonomous driving aids, the 2021 Cadillac Escalade (from $77,490) features an enhanced Super Cruise system, which includes ""lane change on-demand,"" allowing drivers to direct the system to perform a single lane change using the turn signal to indicate the desired direction of the move.  Speaking of lanes, an enhancement to ""dynamic lane offset"" means the Escalade can be nudged slightly into its lane when other vehicles pass closely.  When activated on supported freeways and highways, Super Cruise uses lidar-generated maps, high-precision GPS, cameras and radar sensors to monitor the road, as well as a system to ensure the driver is paying attention. Unlike Tesla's Autopilot, Cadillac's Super Cruise on the 2021 Escalade (or CT6 sedan) does not require motorists' hands on the wheel, but their eyes must remain fixed on the road ahead.  Along with augmented reality (AR)-enabled navigation – which uses live street views to enhance driving directions – the Escalade has an industry-first curved OLED display, which is as thin as a sheet of paper. In total, there are more than 38 inches of screen tech, with twice the pixel density of a 4K television.  Out this fall, the OLED display and AR Navigation come standard with the 2021 Escalade, while the Super Cruise feature costs about $2,500, available on the Premium Luxury, Sports and Platinum trims.  Other tech  Dashboard cameras (""dashcams"") give you peace of mind in case of an incident on the road (or interaction with authorities). The Sylvania Roadsight dash camera line offers a wide-angle HD camera system that loops video recordings of road interactions and automatically saves footage in the event of a detected accident (G-sensor technology). Unlike many other dashcams, the camera connects via its dedicated Wi-Fi to the SYLVANIA Connect mobile app (iOS and Android), which allows drivers to view a live-feed of the camera, adjust settings and download and share footage. Prices start at $59 for the Sylvania Roadsight Rear and up to $149 for the Roadsight Pro model.  Though you may have Siri or Google Assistant to talk to behind the wheel – via Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, respectively – if you prefer Alexa, there's an inexpensive way to add ""her"" to any vehicle. Called Amazon's Echo Auto ($49), this device connects to the Alexa app on your phone and plays through your car's speakers, through wireless Bluetooth or an available aux-in port. Echo Auto features eight microphones and far-field technology, so it can clearly hear you over music, air conditioning, and outside road noise. Along with using your voice to check the news, weather, manage your calendar or make calls, you can also stream content from Audible (audiobooks), Spotify (music and podcasts), Amazon Music, Apple Music, SiriusXM, and radio stations with TuneIn and iHeartRadio. An air vent mount is included.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Tuesday that the test version of the company's Autopilot system will be released in ""a month or so."" While he didn't describe its capabilities, Musk said that once it's out, ""you'll see what it's like. It's amazing. It's clearly going to work."" ","  A number of startups and established automakers have been racing to develop self-driving technology. While it has been fielded in tests, a system that completely drives the car in all circumstances without driver input is yet to become a feature on popular cars. Tesla's current system requires drivers to always pay attention behind the wheel and, frankly, it's not clear how far Tesla's next step will go.  Musk spoke at the company's annual stockholders meeting, a drive-in theater-style event before a sea of Tesla owners in their cars, done in the name of social distancing. They honked in unison whenever Musk announced promising developments.  Musk had said that the company's latest electric cars have all the hardware they need for self driving. All they were missing was the software.  To accomplish the next step, Musk said his team has to completely rewrite the Autopilot software. He has been testing the cutting-edge versions himself.  While a self-driving car would certainly be convenient, Musk added that safety could be the greatest benefit. Musk said he was confident that an advanced Autopilot would allow Teslas to become 10 times less likely to be involved in a serious crash than the industry average.  ""That's a lot of lives saved and a lot of injuries avoided,"" Musk said.  Tesla has seen its fortunes zoom financially this year. By mid-August, its valuation already was three times the value of Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler combined. It did it by creating vehicles that captured the hearts of customers with their plug-in electric drivetrains and the promise of self-driving.  In keeping with their emotional spirit, Tesla created the Models S, X, Y and Model 3 that together spell SEXY – if you flip the 3 backward.  But the company's plans going forward, as outlined to investors, are decidedly unsexy by comparison. Musk said he expects all automakers to eventually offer their own electric and self-driving vehicles, so Tesla will stand apart by becoming the low-cost producer. He said he plans to wring so many cost savings from pioneering manufacturing techniques and battery innovations that the company will be able to offer a true low-priced, self-driving electric model.  ""I think probably about three years from now we are confident we can make a very compelling $25,000 electric vehicle that's also fully autonomous,"" Musk said to a round of approving honks.  Besides the four sedans and SUVs, the company plans to sell electric semitrucks and a radical, angular electric pickup truck. Musk said about 500,000 people have preordered the Cybertruck, Tesla's name for the pickup.  Asked about the future of today's gasoline-powered cars, Musk said he thinks their makers are doomed in the long run. All vehicles, he predicted, run more efficiently on electricity except rockets.  Piston-powered cars will become a curiosity, he said, noting that there are ""some steam engines somewhere.""   CO 	 teslmi : Tesla, Inc.

Imagine a time when daily commutes times are cut in half, or when you don't have to own or operate a car at all to get to your destination. ","  Those types of transportation options are projected to be available by the year 2030 thanks to improvements in electric battery power, internet connectivity and next-level automation.  ""Transportation planning has always been around how to get a vehicle from place to place using roads and traffic lights. But that's changing,"" said Thom Rickert, a risk and insurance specialist at Trident Public Risk Solutions.  The mobility industry's next objective is to focus on moving a person through multiple modes of connected travel.  That's where air taxis, e-scooters, connected trains and semiautonomous cars come into play, powered by widespread 5G connectivity, Rickert said.  Interstate travel  In the coming years, rural pockets of the central U.S. could become better connected to such big cities as Atlanta and Dallas in a effort to reduce overall travel times.  Hyperloop is a transportation method that aims to eliminate the barriers of distance and time over the next few years if regulation and test run estimates go according to plan.  The American company is building out a series of ""passenger capsules"" that can zip through tubes while carrying up to 40 people at a time.  Imagine standing in a futuristic pod that floats inside a vacuum as gradual electric propulsion shoots the vessel to its destination, hundreds of miles away, in mere minutes. Think of it as a mix between a bullet train and an autonomous vehicle inside a long tube.  ""You're going to see a huge boom from the middle of the country if Hyperloop takes off in those places,"" said Ryan Kelly, head of marketing and communications at Hyperloop. The company is building pilot tubes in Dubai and working with states in the U.S. to get the project off the ground.  ""The first thing you'll see is safety certification by 2024,"" Kelly said. Then 6-mile tracks will be built throughout parts of middle America.  In an age when people want to connect to transportation in lightning speed, traffic congestion, population growth and an expanding job market have led to an increase in commute times across the country's metro areas, transportation authorities say.  Average commute times across the country edged up from 25 minutes in 2009 to more than 27 minutes in 2019, according to the Census Bureau.  But in metro areas, the average one-way commute can be as long as 43 minutes, according to a study by Best Mattress Brand, a company that researches the causes of sleep issues that affect driving abilities. Big cities tend to have more people and greater congestion traffic.  Aviation  Shorter distance or ""last-mile"" travel will be revolutionized through the widespread adoption of 5G connectivity which will allow machines to communicate with each other directly, enabling more cars and other means of transportation to travel at faster speeds without humans operating them.  Current wireless networks, for example, haven't been strong enough to send reliable signals to aircraft throughout a flight, according to Laurie Garrow, associate director for the Center for Urban and Regional Air Mobility at Georgia Tech.  Toward the end of the decade, ""5G connectivity will allow us to design air taxis and give us the ability to think about truly moving toward autonomous control of aircraft,"" Garrow said.  She projects electric take-off and landing aircraft displacing some of the helicopters in operation today. ""And we will see new markets open up with these aircraft,"" Garrow said.  Though such hurdles as safety regulations, noise concerns and infrastructure needs could prolong projected launch dates, Uber and Hyundai plan on lifting air taxis into the skies in the next few years. Other electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicle companies have similar plans.  Electric travel  As engineering costs fall and battery power continues to improve, the electric vehicles market will continue to grow, though EVs aren't expected to overtake gas-powered cars anytime soon, according to Joe Wiesenfelder, the executive editor at Cars.com.  ""Overall (EV) use in the country will continue to lag due to consistently low gas prices, lack of public infrastructure, the recent EPA/California ruling and pending trade wars,"" Wiesenfelder said in a statement.  In 2019, EVs represented about 1% of the cars on the road in the U.S. Auto industry analyst Eric Lyman told USA TODAY he projects EVs could make up 5% of car sales by 2025.  Car ownership  As EVs gain traction, an increase in such transportation alternatives as air taxis could lead to a gradual decline in car ownership within the next five years, Rickert said.  ""As all these different solutions are tested, perfected, adjusted and evolved, there will be less of a dependence on an automobile"" and less traffic on the ground, Rickert, an insurance specialist, said. ""Especially in urban areas.""  Over-the-air updates  Everyday vehicles that are capable of receiving over-the-air updates from automakers will become ubiquitous as drivers want their cars to be just as updatable as smartphones.  ""You don't want to hear that your vehicle that lasts an average 11 years is out of date,"" Wiesenfelder said.  Much like smartphones, older connected cars can get some of the same features as new cars thanks to regular airwave updates. Tesla kickstarted the trend and OTA updates have begun to spread throughout the auto industry as companies including Ford, BMW and GM roll out updatable vehicle platforms.  Autonomous driving  Experts say self-driving features will reach an inflection point over the next several years, though vehicles aren't expected to be able to do all the driving.  ""More and more vehicles will have standard equipment with basic automation like lane-keeping assist, automated braking and left-hand turn assistance,"" Rickert said. ""Those things that can detect blind spots and tell one vehicle whether another is about to turn, will reduce more accidents.""  However, Level 5 autonomy, where a vehicle can go any place at any time without intervention by a human, isn't expected to be widely available until after 2030.  ""I do see those types of vehicles being used in geo-gated areas where they can be more controlled,"" Ricker said. ""Whereas wider deployment on interstate highways, it's going to take a while to get there.""
