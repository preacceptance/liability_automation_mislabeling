Tesla CEO Elon Musk denied that what Tesla was doing amounted to a recall.  ""The word 'recall' for an over-the-air software update is anachronistic and just flat wrong!"" he tweeted.  The recall covers 2016-2023 Model S, Model X, 2017-2023 Model 3 and 2020-2023 Model Y vehicles equipped with FSD Beta software or pending installation.  ""The feature could potentially infringe upon local traffic laws or customs while executing certain driving maneuvers,"" NHTSA said.  The problem could occur in situations such as traveling or turning through certain intersections during a yellow traffic light and making a lane change out of certain turn-only lanes to continue traveling straight.  NHTSA said ""the system may respond insufficiently to changes in posted speed limits or not adequately account for the driver's adjustment of the vehicle's speed to exceed posted speed limits.""

The vehicle apparently flipped several times before landing on its wheels.  Patel is listed as a radiologist at Providence Holy Cross Medical Center in the Mission Hills area of Los Angeles, KABC TV reported.  ""Providence Holy Cross Medical Center is deeply saddened to learn of a traffic incident involving one of our physicians and his family,"" the hospital told the outlet Tuesday. ""We are extremely grateful there were no serious injuries.""  Drive-mode probe  Investigators have not yet determined which Tesla driving mode was running - including whether it had its Autopilot function on - but don't believe the mode contributed to the crash, CBS News reported.  ""This remains an ongoing investigation and no further information is being released at this time,"" the CHP said.  Several neighbors of the Patels were shocked to hear of the crash and subsequent arrest.  ""They're like ideal neighbors,"" Sarah Walker told KABC. ""It seemed like they had a great holiday, they went to go see both parents. It just seemed very happy and great.""  And next-door neighbor ""Heather"" said the couple are ""lovely people.""  The family members were initially listed in critical condition but all four were conscious and alert when rescuers arrived. There was no guardrail at the spot where the white Tesla went over the edge.  ""We go there all the time for cars over the cliff and they never live,"" Brian Pottenger, a battalion chief for Coastside Fire Protection District/Cal Fire, said Monday. ""This was an absolute miracle.""  First responders set up a rope system from the highway to lower firefighters down the cliff to investigate the crash, Pottenger said.  At the same time, other firefighters using binoculars suddenly noticed movement from the mangled vehicle - and a body-recovery operation quickly became a frantic rescue operation amid rain, heavy winds and crashing waves.  The car's doors were jammed shut, so firefighters were forced to cut the victims out of the wreckage using so-called ""jaws of life"" tools.  The children were pulled out of the back window and brought up the cliff by hand in a rescue basket using a rope system. They were rushed to a hospital by ambulance with musculoskeletal injuries.  The parents had traumatic injuries and had to be hoisted by a helicopter that flew them to the hospital, the battalion chief said.  In 2018, a woman intentionally drove off a Northern California cliff in an SUV with her wife and their six adopted children, officials said. Everyone was killed.

An all-electric BMW iX SUV crossed into the opposite lane of the B28 federal highway near Roemerstein on Monday, crashing into two vehicles and indirectly causing two others to crash into each other. ","  A 33-year-old woman was killed and nine others, including the 43-year-old driver of the BMW and his 18-month-old passenger, were seriously injured.

A Special Crash Investigations team was sent to probe the fatal collision Wednesday, where a 2015 model year Tesla hit the back of a semi-trailer at a rest area near Gainesville, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Friday. ","  The agency would not divulge whether the Tesla was using the company's partially automated driving ­technology.  The vehicle was traveling on Interstate 75 about 2 p.m. Wednesday when, for an unknown reason, it careened into a rest area.

The car rear-ended the tractor-trailer, a CBS affiliate reported.  The driver and passenger, both from Lompoc, Calif., were pronounced dead at the scene. The two who died were a 66-year-old woman and a 67-year-old man, according to a local news outlet.  Highway Patrol Lt. P.V.

""That is a consideration that will be explored during our investigation,"" he said.  Many investigations  NHTSA is probing 37 crashes involving automated-driving systems since 2016. Of the incidents, 30 involved Teslas, including 11 fatal crashes that have killed 15.  The agency also said in documents that it's investigating a fatal pedestrian crash earlier in July in California that involved a Tesla Model 3. It also sent a team to probe a Cruise automated-vehicle crash in California that caused a minor injury in June.  NHTSA also has been investigating Teslas on autopilot crashing into parked emergency vehicles. In a separate probe, it is looking at Teslas on autopilot braking for no apparent reason.  Last week, new NHTSA Administrator Steven Cliff told The Associated Press that the agency is escalating efforts to understand the risks posed by automated-vehicle technology so it can determine what rules may be necessary to protect drivers, passengers and pedestrians.

Cars from Elon Musk's electric automaker were responsible for about 70% of a total 392 driver- assist-involved crashes from July 1 of last year to May 15 of this year, figures from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration show. ","  Hyundai came in second, with 90 driver-assist-involved crashes, followed by Subaru with 10 and Ford with five. Other automakers including Toyota, BMW, Porsche, Hyundai and General Motors all reported fewer than five driver-assist-related crashes each.  The news comes after the NHTSA last week escalated a probe into Tesla's Autopilot system, which helps keep vehicles within lanes and automatically adjusts cruise-control speed based on the flow of traffic. Autopilot still requires human oversight and is less ambitious than Tesla's Full Self Driving feature, which automates driving even on congested city streets.  The agency said it had advanced its ongoing probe into Autopilot- related crashes to an engineering analysis - the final step required before federal officials decide whether to impose a recall.  In a call with reporters on Wednesday, NHTSA Administrator Steven Cliff cautioned that the data lacks context and is meant as a guide to help identify safety trends, according to CNBC.  ""I would advise caution before attempting to draw conclusions based only on the data that we're releasing,"" Cliff said, according to the outlet. ""In fact, the data alone may raise more questions than they answer.""  The NHTSA first started requiring carmakers to report driver- assist-related crashes last year.

Markey did not give any indication of what sort of branding he would prefer for Autopilot, though one Twitter user took a page out of Musk's book and suggested it be called ""œNot Autopilot,"" a reference to the Not-a-Flamethrower sold by Musk's Boring Company.  Though Tesla has upgraded its steering wheel monitoring following news reports in recent years, Markey says that the vehicle's ""œinherent flaw"" is the company's ""œdecision to over-rely"" on the hand-pressure system. He wants it to introduce new redundancy measures to promote safety.  Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.  Shares of the automaker closed down 1.3 percent Friday, at $564.82.
