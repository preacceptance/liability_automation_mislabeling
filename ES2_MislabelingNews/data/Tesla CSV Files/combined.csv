The recall covers 2016-2023 Model S, Model X, 2017-2023 Model 3 and 2020-2023 Model Y vehicles equipped with FSD Beta software or pending installation.  ""The feature could potentially infringe upon local traffic laws or customs while executing certain driving maneuvers,"" NHTSA said.  The problem could occur in situations such as traveling or turning through certain intersections during a yellow traffic light and making a lane change out of certain turn-only lanes to continue traveling straight.

Dharmesh Patel, a 41-year-old physician from Pasadena, will be booked on attempted-murder and child-abuse charges once he's out of the hospital, the California Highway Patrol said in a statement.","""CHP investigators worked throughout the night interviewing witnesses and gathering evidence from the scene,"" the Highway Patrol said in a statement.

Patel, wife Neha and their kids - a 7-year-old girl and 4-year-old boy - miraculously survived after the electric car careened off the notoriously perilous part of the Pacific Coast Highway known as the ""Devil's Slide"" at about 10:50 a.m. Monday. The vehicle apparently flipped several times before landing on its wheels.  Patel is listed as a radiologist at Providence Holy Cross Medical Center in the Mission Hills area of Los Angeles, KABC TV reported.  ""Providence Holy Cross Medical Center is deeply saddened to learn of a traffic incident involving one of our physicians and his family,"" the hospital told the outlet Tuesday.

""It seemed like they had a great holiday, they went to go see both parents. It just seemed very happy and great.""  And next-door neighbor ""Heather"" said the couple are ""lovely people.""  The family members were initially listed in critical condition but all four were conscious and alert when rescuers arrived. There was no guardrail at the spot where the white Tesla went over the edge.  ""We go there all the time for cars over the cliff and they never live,"" Brian Pottenger, a battalion chief for Coastside Fire Protection District/Cal Fire, said Monday. ""This was an absolute miracle.""  First responders set up a rope system from the highway to lower firefighters down the cliff to investigate the crash, Pottenger said.  At the same time, other firefighters using binoculars suddenly noticed movement from the mangled vehicle - and a body-recovery operation quickly became a frantic rescue operation amid rain, heavy winds and crashing waves.  The car's doors were jammed shut, so firefighters were forced to cut the victims out of the wreckage using so-called ""jaws of life"" tools.  The children were pulled out of the back window and brought up the cliff by hand in a rescue basket using a rope system. They were rushed to a hospital by ambulance with musculoskeletal injuries.  The parents had traumatic injuries and had to be hoisted by a helicopter that flew them to the hospital, the battalion chief said.  In 2018, a woman intentionally drove off a Northern California cliff in an SUV with her wife and their six adopted children, officials said. Everyone was killed.

It also sent a team to probe a Cruise automated-vehicle crash in California that caused a minor injury in June.  NHTSA also has been investigating Teslas on autopilot crashing into parked emergency vehicles. In a separate probe, it is looking at Teslas on autopilot braking for no apparent reason.  Last week, new NHTSA Administrator Steven Cliff told The Associated Press that the agency is escalating efforts to understand the risks posed by automated-vehicle technology so it can determine what rules may be necessary to protect drivers, passengers and pedestrians.

The news comes after the NHTSA last week escalated a probe into Tesla's Autopilot system, which helps keep vehicles within lanes and automatically adjusts cruise-control speed based on the flow of traffic. Autopilot still requires human oversight and is less ambitious than Tesla's Full Self Driving feature, which automates driving even on congested city streets.  The agency said it had advanced its ongoing probe into Autopilot- related crashes to an engineering analysis - the final step required before federal officials decide whether to impose a recall.  In a call with reporters on Wednesday, NHTSA Administrator Steven Cliff cautioned that the data lacks context and is meant as a guide to help identify safety trends, according to CNBC.

Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) on Friday called on Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk to rebrand the Autopilot feature of his electric vehicles, saying it's ""œan inherently misleading name"" because the cars cannot actually fully drive themselves.","Markey, a member of the Senate's Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, has been probing Tesla's Autopilot since Boston news stations last year reported on a viral video of a man who appeared to be asleep while his Tesla sped along the Massachusetts Turnpike.  Autopilot helps Tesla drivers steer, accelerate and brake automatically in their lane, but requires them to keep their hands on the steering wheel at all times.  Markey called for the name change - among other tweaks - to stop Tesla owners from tricking the driver-assistance program into doing all the work. Drivers have been getting around the hands-on-wheel requirement by resting only one hand on the wheel, tying a weight to the wheel ""œand wedging a water bottle or an orange"" into the wheel, Markey claimed.  Tesla Autopilot has been involved in five fatal crashes since 2016, including a grisly accident in Mountain View, Calif., just 15 minutes away from the company's headquarters, that left the driver dead after his Model X hit a highway divider.  The function also made headlines last year when an amateur porn star filmed a video in a self-driving Tesla.  Musk merely laughed along after the video was uploaded to Pornhub: ""œTurns out there's more way [sic] to use Autopilot than we imagined,"" he wrote on Twitter.  Markey did not give any indication of what sort of branding he would prefer for Autopilot, though one Twitter user took a page out of Musk's book and suggested it be called ""œNot Autopilot,"" a reference to the Not-a-Flamethrower sold by Musk's Boring Company.  Though Tesla has upgraded its steering wheel monitoring following news reports in recent years, Markey says that the vehicle's ""œinherent flaw"" is the company's ""œdecision to over-rely"" on the hand-pressure system. He wants it to introduce new redundancy measures to promote safety.  Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.  Shares of the automaker closed down 1.3 percent Friday, at $564.82.

All Rights Reserved.","Missy Cummings, who spent more than a year at the federal auto safety agency, said that drivers were putting too much trust in systems like Tesla's Autopilot and that regulators needed to restrict their use.  Last fall, Missy Cummings sent a document to her colleagues at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that revealed a surprising trend: When people using advanced driver-assistance systems die or are injured in a car crash, they are more likely to have been speeding than people driving cars on their own.","The two-page analysis of nearly 400 crashes involving systems like Tesla's Autopilot and General Motors' Super Cruise is far from conclusive. But it raises fresh questions about the technologies that have been installed in hundreds of thousands of cars on U.S. roads. Dr. Cummings said the data indicated that drivers were becoming too confident in the systems' abilities and that automakers and regulators should restrict when and how the technology was used.  People ''are over-trusting the technology,'' she said. ''They are letting the cars speed. And they are getting into accidents that are seriously injuring them or killing them.''  Dr. Cummings, an engineering and computer science professor at George Mason University who specializes in autonomous systems, recently returned to academia after more than a year at the safety agency. On Wednesday, she will present some of her findings at the University of Michigan, a short drive from Detroit, the main hub of the U.S. auto industry.  Systems like Autopilot and Super Cruise, which can steer, brake and accelerate vehicles on their own, are becoming increasingly common as automakers compete to win over car buyers with promises of superior technology. Companies sometimes market these systems as if they made cars autonomous. But their legal fine print requires drivers to stay alert and be ready to take control of the vehicle at any time.  In interviews last week, Dr. Cummings said automakers and regulators ought to prevent such systems from operating over the speed limit and require drivers using them to keep their hands on the steering wheel and eyes on the road.  ''Car companies -- meaning Tesla and others -- are marketing this as a hands-free technology,'' she said. ''That is a nightmare.''  But these are not measures that NHTSA can easily put in place. Any effort to rein in how driver-assistance systems are used will probably be met with criticism and lawsuits from the auto industry, especially from Tesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, who has long chafed at rules he considers antiquated.  Safety experts also said the agency was chronically underfunded and lacked enough skilled staff to adequately do its job. The agency has also operated without a permanent leader confirmed by the Senate for much of the past six years.  Dr. Cummings acknowledged that putting in effect the rules she was calling for would be difficult. She said she also knew that her comments could again inflame supporters of Mr. Musk and Tesla who attacked her on social media and sent her death threats after she was appointed a senior adviser at the safety agency.  But Dr. Cummings, 56, one of the first female fighter pilots in the Navy, said she felt compelled to speak out because ''the technology is being abused by humans.''  ''We need to put in regulations that deal with this,'' she said.  The safety agency and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. G.M. pointed to studies that it had conducted with the University of Michigan that examined the safety of its technology.  Because Autopilot and other similar systems allow drivers to relinquish active control of the car, many safety experts worry that the technology will lull people into believing the cars are driving themselves. When the technology malfunctions or cannot handle situations like having to veer quickly to miss stalled vehicles, drivers may be unprepared to take control quickly enough.  The systems use cameras and other sensors to check whether a driver's hands are on the wheel and his or her eyes are watching the road. And they will disengage if the driver is not attentive for a significant amount of time. But they operate for stretches when the driver is not focused on driving.  Dr. Cummings has long warned that this can be a problem -- in academic papers, in interviews and on social media. She was named senior adviser for safety at NHTSA in October 2021, not long after the agency began collecting crash data involving cars using driver-assistance systems.  Mr. Musk responded to her appointment in a post on Twitter, accusing her of being ''extremely biased against Tesla,'' without citing any evidence. This set off an avalanche of similar statements from his supporters on social media and in emails to Dr. Cummings.  She said she eventually had to shut down her Twitter account and temporarily leave her home because of the harassment and death threats she was receiving at the time. One threat was serious enough to be investigated by the police in Durham, N.C., where she lived.  Many of the claims were nonsensical and false. Some of Mr. Musk's supporters noticed that she was serving as a board member of Veoneer, a Swedish company that sells sensors to Tesla and other automakers, but confused the company with Velodyne, a U.S. company whose laser sensor technology -- called lidar -- is seen as a competitor to the sensors that Tesla uses for Autopilot.  ''We know you own lidar companies and if you accept the NHTSA adviser position, we will kill you and your family,'' one email sent to her said.  Jennifer Homendy, who leads the National Transportation Safety Board, the agency that investigates serious automobile crashes, and who has also been attacked by fans of Mr. Musk, told CNN Business in 2021 that the false claims about Dr. Cummings were a ''calculated attempt to distract from the real safety issues.''  Before joining NHTSA, Dr. Cummings left Veoneer's board, sold her shares in the company and recused herself from the agency's investigations that solely involved Tesla, one of which was announced before her arrival.  The analysis she sent to agency officials in the fall looked at advanced driver-assistance systems from multiple companies, including Tesla, G.M. and Ford Motor. When cars using these systems were involved in fatal crashes, they were traveling over the speed limit 50 percent of the time. In crashes with serious injuries, they were speeding 42 percent of the time.  In crashes that did not involve driver-assistance systems, those figures were 29 percent and 13 percent.  The amount of data that the government has collected on crashes involving these systems is still relatively small. Other factors could be skewing the results.  Advanced drivers-assistance systems are used far more often on highways than on city streets, for instance. And the crash data that Dr. Cummings analyzed is dominated by Tesla, because its systems are more widely used than others. This could mean that the results unfairly reflect on the performance of systems offered by other companies.  During her time at the federal safety agency, she also examined so-called phantom braking, which is when driver-assistance systems cause cars to slow or stop for no apparent reason. Last month, for example, the news site The Intercept published footage of a Tesla vehicle inexplicably braking in the middle of the Bay Bridge connecting San Francisco and Oakland and causing an eight-car pileup that injured nine people, including a 2-year-old.  Dr. Cummings said data from automakers and customer complaints showed that this was a problem with multiple driver-assistance systems and with robotaxis developed by companies like Waymo, owned by Google's parent company, and Cruise, a division of G.M. Now under test in multiple cities, these self-driving taxis are designed to operate with no driver, and they are ferrying passengers in San Francisco and the Phoenix area.  Many crashes apparently happen because people traveling behind these cars are not prepared for those erratic stops. ''The cars are braking in ways that people do not anticipate and are not able to respond to,'' she said.  Waymo and Cruise declined to comment.  Dr. Cummings said the federal safety agency should work with automakers to restrict advanced driver-assistance systems using its standard recall process, where the companies agree to voluntarily make changes.  But experts questioned whether the automakers would make such changes without a significant fight.  The agency could also establish new rules that explicitly control the use of these systems, but this would take years and could result in lawsuits.  ''NHTSA could do this, but would the courts uphold it?'' said Matthew Wansley, a professor at the Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University in New York who specializes in emerging automotive technologies.  Dr. Cummings said robotaxis were arriving at about the right pace: After limited tests, federal, state and local regulators are keeping a lid on their growth until the technology is better understood.  But, she said, the government must do more to ensure the safety of advanced driver-assistance systems like Autopilot and Super Cruise.  NHTSA ''needs to flex its muscles more,'' she said. ''It needs to not be afraid of Elon or of moving markets if there is an obvious unreasonable risk.''

"Document NYTF000020230122ej1m0006g","Magazine Desk; SECTMM","Elon Musk's Collision Course","By Christopher Cox","7464 words","22 January 2023","The New York Times","NYTF","Late Edition - Final","26",NA,"English","Copyright 2023 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.","To hear more audio stories from publications like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android .  Early on, the software had the regrettable habit of hitting police cruisers. No one knew why, though Tesla's engineers had some good guesses: Stationary objects and flashing lights seemed to trick the A.I. The car would be driving along normally, the computer well in control, and suddenly it would veer to the right or left and -- smash -- at least 10 times in just over three years.","For a company that depended on an unbounded sense of optimism among investors to maintain its high stock price -- Tesla was at one point worth more than Toyota, Honda, Volkswagen, Mercedes, BMW, Ford and General Motors combined -- these crashes might seem like a problem. But to Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, they presented an opportunity. Each collision generated data, and with enough data, the company could speed the development of the world's first truly self-driving car. He believed in this vision so strongly that it led him to make wild predictions: ''My guess as to when we would think it is safe for somebody to essentially fall asleep and wake up at their destination: probably toward the end of next year,'' Musk said in 2019. ''I would say I am certain of that. That is not a question mark.''  The future of Tesla may rest on whether drivers knew that they were engaged in this data-gathering experiment, and if so, whether their appetite for risk matched Musk's. I wanted to hear from the victims of some of the more minor accidents, but they tended to fall into two categories, neither of which predisposed them to talk: They either loved Tesla and Musk and didn't want to say anything negative to the press, or they were suing the company and remaining silent on the advice of counsel. (Umair Ali, whose Tesla steered into a highway barrier in 2017, had a different excuse: ''Put me down as declined interview because I don't want to piss off the richest man in the world.'')  Then I found Dave Key. On May 29, 2018, Key's 2015 Tesla Model S was driving him home from the dentist in Autopilot mode. It was a route that Key had followed countless times before: a two-lane highway leading up into the hills above Laguna Beach, Calif. But on this trip, while Key was distracted, the car drifted out of its lane and slammed into the back of a parked police S.U.V., spinning the car around and pushing the S.U.V. up onto the sidewalk. No one was hurt.  Key, a 69-year-old former software entrepreneur, took a dispassionate, engineer's-eye view of his own accident. ''The problem with stationary objects -- I'm sorry, this sounds stupid -- is that they don't move,'' he said. For years, Tesla's artificial intelligence had trouble separating immobile objects from the background. Rather than feeling frustrated that the computer hadn't figured out such a seemingly elementary problem, Key took comfort in learning that there was a reason behind the crash: a known software limitation, rather than some kind of black-swan event.  Last fall, I asked Key to visit the scene of the accident with me. He said he would do me one better; he would take me there using Tesla's new Full Self-Driving mode, which was still in beta. I told Key that I was surprised he was still driving a Tesla, much less paying extra -- F.S.D. now costs $15,000 -- for new autonomous features. If my car had tried to kill me, I would have switched brands. But in the months and years after his Model S was totaled, he bought three more.  We met for breakfast at a cafe in Laguna Beach, about three miles from the crash site. Key was wearing a black V-neck T-shirt, khaki shorts and sandals: Southern California semiretirement chic. As we walked to our table, he locked the doors of his red 2022 Model S, and the side mirrors folded up like a dog's ears when it's being petted.  Key had brought along a four-page memo he drafted for our interview, listing facts about the accident, organized under subheadings like ''Tesla Full Self-Driving Technology (Discussion).'' He's the sort of man who walks around with a battery of fully formed opinions on life's most important subjects -- computers, software, exercise, money -- and a willingness to share them. He was particularly concerned that I understand that Autopilot and F.S.D. were saving lives: ''The data shows that their accident rate while on Beta is far less than other cars,'' one bullet point read, in 11-point Calibri. ''Slowing down the F.S.D. Beta will result in more accidents and loss of life based on hard statistical data.''  Accidents like his -- and even the deadly ones -- are unfortunate, he argued, but they couldn't distract society from the larger goal of widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles. Key drew an analogy to the coronavirus vaccines, which prevented hundreds of thousands of deaths but also caused rare deaths and injuries from adverse reactions. ''As a society,'' he concluded, ''we choose the path to save the most lives.''  We finished breakfast and walked to the car. Key had hoped to show off the newest version of F.S.D., but his system hadn't updated yet. ''Elon said it would be released at the end of the week,'' he said. ''Well, it's Sunday.'' Musk had been hinting for weeks that the update would be a drastic improvement over F.S.D. 10.13, which had been released over the summer. Because Musk liked to make little jokes out of the names and numbers in his life, the version number would jump to 10.69 with this release. (The four available Tesla models are S, 3, X and Y, presumably because that spells the word ''sexy.'')  Key didn't want to talk about Musk, but the executive's reputational collapse had become impossible to ignore. He was in the middle of his bizarre, on-again-off-again campaign to take over Twitter, to the dismay of Tesla loyalists. And though he hadn't yet attacked Anthony Fauci or spread conspiracy theories about Nancy Pelosi's husband or gone on a journalist-banning spree on the platform, the question was already suggesting itself: How do you explain Elon Musk?  ''People are flawed,'' Key said cautiously, before repeating a sentiment that Musk often said about himself: If partisans on both sides hated him, he must be doing something right. No matter what trouble Musk got himself into, Key said, he was honest -- ''truthful to his detriment.''  As we drove, Key compared F.S.D. and the version of Autopilot on his 2015 Tesla. Autopilot, he said, was like fancy cruise control: speed, steering, crash avoidance. Though in his case, he said, ''I guess it didn't do crash avoidance.'' He had been far more impressed by F.S.D. It was able to handle just about any situation he threw at it. ''My only real complaint is it doesn't always select the lane that I would.''  After a minute, the car warned Key to keep his hands on the wheel and eyes on the road. ''Tesla now is kind of a nanny about that,'' he complained. If Autopilot was once dangerously permissive of inattentive drivers -- allowing them to nod off behind the wheel, even -- that flaw, like the stationary-object bug, had been fixed. ''Between the steering wheel and the eye tracking, that's just a solved problem,'' Key said.  Soon we were close to the scene of the crash. Scrub-covered hills with mountain-biking trails lacing through them rose on either side of us. That was what got Key into trouble on the day of the accident. He was looking at a favorite trail and ignoring the road. ''I looked up to the left, and the car went off to the right,'' he said. ''I was in this false sense of security.''  We parked at the spot where he hit the police S.U.V. four years earlier. There was nothing special about the road here: no strange lines, no confusing lane shift, no merge. Just a single lane of traffic running along a row of parked cars. Why the Tesla failed at that moment was a mystery.  Eventually, Key told F.S.D. to take us back to the cafe. As we started our left turn, though, the steering wheel spasmed and the brake pedal juddered. Key muttered a nervous, ''OK. ... ''  After another moment, the car pulled halfway across the road and stopped. A line of cars was bearing down on our broadside. Key hesitated a second but then quickly took over and completed the turn. ''It probably could have then accelerated, but I wasn't willing to cut it that close,'' he said. If he was wrong, of course, there was a good chance that he would have had his second A.I.-caused accident on the same one-mile stretch of road.  Three weeks before Key hit the police S.U.V., Musk wrote an email to Jim Riley, whose son Barrett died after his Tesla crashed while speeding. Musk sent Riley his condolences, and the grieving father wrote back to ask whether Tesla's software could be updated to allow an owner to set a maximum speed for the car, along with other restrictions on acceleration, access to the radio and the trunk and distance the car could drive from home. Musk, while sympathetic, replied: ''If there are a large number of settings, it will be too complex for most people to use. I want to make sure that we get this right. Most good for most number of people.''  It was a stark demonstration of what makes Musk so unusual as a chief executive. First, he reached out directly to someone who was harmed by one of his products -- something it's hard to imagine the head of G.M. or Ford contemplating, if only for legal reasons. (Indeed, this email was entered into evidence after Riley sued Tesla.) And then Musk rebuffed Riley. No vague ''I'll look into it'' or ''We'll see what we can do.'' Riley receives a hard no.  Like Key, I want to resist Musk's tendency to make every story about him. Tesla is a big car company with thousands of employees. It existed before Elon Musk. It might exist after Elon Musk. But if you want a parsimonious explanation for the challenges the company faces -- in the form of the lawsuits, a crashing stock price and an A.I. that still seems all too capable of catastrophic failure -- you should look to its mercurial, brilliant, sophomoric chief executive.  Perhaps there's no mystery here: Musk is simply a narcissist, and every reckless swerve he makes is meant solely to draw the world's attention. He seemed to endorse this theory in a tongue-in-cheek way during a recent deposition, when a lawyer asked him, ''Do you have some kind of unique ability to identify narcissistic sociopaths?'' and he replied, ''You mean by looking in the mirror?''  But what looks like self-obsession and poor impulse control might instead be the fruits of a coherent philosophy, one that Musk has detailed on many occasions. It's there in the email to Riley: the greatest good for the greatest number of people. That dictum, as part of an ad hoc system of utilitarian ethics, can explain all sorts of mystifying decisions that Musk has made, not least his breakneck pursuit of A.I., which in the long term, he believes, will save countless lives.  Unfortunately for Musk, the short term comes first, and his company faces a rough few months. In February, the first lawsuit against Tesla for a crash involving Autopilot will go to trial. Four more will follow in quick succession. Donald Slavik, who will represent plaintiffs in as many as three of those cases, says that a normal car company would have settled by now: ''They look at it as a cost of doing business.'' Musk has vowed to fight it out in court, no matter the dangers this might present for Tesla. ''The dollars can add up,'' Slavik said, ''especially if there's any finding of punitive damages.''  Slavik sent me one of the complaints he filed against Tesla, which lists prominent Autopilot crashes from A to Z -- in fact, from A to WW. In China, a Tesla slammed into the back of a street sweeper. In Florida, a Tesla hit a tractor-trailer that was stretched across two lanes of a highway. During a downpour in Indiana, a Tesla Model 3 hydroplaned off the road and burst into flames. In the Florida Keys, a Model S drove through an intersection and killed a pedestrian. In New York, a Model Y struck a man who was changing his tire on the shoulder of the Long Island Expressway. In Montana, a Tesla steered unexpectedly into a highway barrier. Then the same thing happened in Dallas and in Mountain View and in San Jose.  The arrival of self-driving vehicles wasn't meant to be like this. Day in, day out, we scare and maim and kill ourselves in cars. In the United States last year, there were around 11 million road accidents, nearly five million injuries and more than 40,000 deaths. Tesla's A.I. was meant to put an end to this blood bath. Instead, on average, there is at least one Autopilot-related crash in the United States every day, and Tesla is under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  Ever since Autopilot was released in October 2015, Musk has encouraged drivers to think of it as more advanced than it was, stating in January 2016 that it was ''probably better'' than a human driver. That November, the company released a video of a Tesla navigating the roads of the Bay Area with the disclaimer: ''The person in the driver's seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself.'' Musk also rejected the name ''Copilot'' in favor of ''Autopilot.''  The fine print made clear that the technology was for driver assistance only, but that message received a fraction of the attention of Musk's announcements. A large number of drivers seemed genuinely confused about Autopilot's capabilities. (Tesla also declined to disclose that the car in the 2016 video crashed in the company's parking lot.) Slavik's legal complaint doesn't hold back: ''Tesla's conduct was despicable, and so contemptible that it would be looked down upon and despised by ordinary decent people.''  The many claims of the pending lawsuits come back to a single theme: Tesla consistently inflated consumer expectations and played down the dangers involved. The cars didn't have sufficient driver monitoring because Musk didn't want drivers to think that the car needed human supervision. (Musk in April 2019: ''If you have a system that's at or below human-level reliability, then driver monitoring makes sense. But if your system is dramatically better, more reliable than a human, then monitoring does not help much.'') Drivers weren't warned about problems with automatic braking or ''uncommanded lane changes.'' The company would admit to the technology's limitations in the user manual but publish viral videos of a Tesla driving a complicated route with no human intervention.  Musk's ideal customer was someone like Key -- willing to accept the blame when something went wrong but possessing almost limitless faith in the next update. In a deposition, an engineer at Tesla made this all but explicit: ''We want to let the customer know that, No. 1, you should have confidence in your vehicle: Everything is working just as it should. And, secondly, the reason for your accident or reason for your incident always falls back on you.''  After our failed left turn in Laguna Beach, Key quickly diagnosed the problem. If only the system had upgraded to F.S.D. 10.69, he argued, the car surely would have managed the turn safely. Unfortunately for Musk, not every Tesla owner is like Dave Key. The plaintiffs in the Autopilot lawsuits might agree that the A.I. is improving, but only on the backs of the early adopters and bystanders who might be killed along the way.  Online, there's a battle between pro-Musk and anti-Musk factions about Autopilot and F.S.D. Reddit has a forum called r/RealTesla that showcases the most embarrassing A.I. screw-ups, along with more generic complaints: squeaky steering wheels, leaky roofs, haywire electronics, noisy cabins, stiff suspensions, wrinkled leather seats, broken door handles. The Musk stans tend to sequester themselves in r/TeslaMotors, where they post Tesla sightings, cheer on the company's latest factory openings and await the next big announcement from the boss.  I found David Alford on YouTube, where he posted a video called ''Tesla Full Self-Driving Running a Red Light.'' In it, we see the view through the windshield as Alford's car approaches an intersection with a left-turn lane that has a dedicated traffic signal. With a few hundred yards remaining, the light shifts from green to red, but the car doesn't stop. Instead, it rolls into the intersection, where it's on track to collide with oncoming traffic, until Alford takes over.  In the comments, Tesla fans grow angry with Alford for posting the video, but he pushes back: ''How does it help put pressure on Tesla to improve their systems if you are scared to post their faults?'' Replying to one comment, he writes that F.S.D. is ''unethical in the context they are using it.''  When I called Alford, I was expecting someone suited for r/RealTesla, but he ended up having more of an r/TeslaMotors vibe. He told me that he would be willing to take me to the site of his video and demonstrate the failure, but first I had to make a promise. ''The only thing I ask is try not to put me in a bad light toward Tesla,'' he said. ''I don't want anybody to think that I hate the company or whatnot, because I'm a very, very big supporter of them.''  Alford lives in Fresno, Calif., and before I went to meet him one day last fall, he told me some exciting news: He had just received the F.S.D. 10.69 update. Our drive would be his first attempt to navigate the intersection from the YouTube video with the new system.  The morning I met him, he was wearing a black T-shirt that showed off his tattoos, black sunglasses and faded black jeans with holes in the knees. Hollywood would typecast him as a white-hat hacker, and indeed he's a software guy like Key: He is a product engineer for a Bay Area tech company.  His white 2020 Tesla Model 3 had a magnetic bumper sticker he found on Etsy: CAUTION FULL SELF-DRIVING TESTING IN PROGRESS. He said he drives in F.S.D. mode 90 percent of the time, so his car is always acting a bit strange -- the sticker helped keep some of the honking from other cars at bay. He seemed to be, like Key, an ideal F.S.D. beta tester: interested in the software, alert to its flaws, dogged in his accumulation of autonomous miles.  I climbed into the passenger seat, and Alford punched in our first destination: a spot a few blocks away in downtown Fresno. We were lucky it was overcast, he said, because the car behaved well in these conditions. On days when it was sunny out and there was a lot of glare, the car could be ''moody.'' And when it was foggy, and it was often foggy in Fresno, ''it freaks out.''  After a few minutes, we approached a crosswalk just as two parents pulling a child in a wagon began to cross. A screen next to the steering wheel showed that the A.I. had registered the two pedestrians but not the wagon. Alford said he was hovering his foot over the brake, but the car stopped on its own.  After the wagon came a woman in a wheelchair. The car stayed put. Alford told me that the automotive jargon for anyone on the street who is not in a car or a truck is a ''V.R.U.,'' a vulnerable road user. And it's true: Pedestrians and cyclists and children in strollers and women in wheelchairs -- they are so fragile compared with these giant machines we've stuffed into our cities and onto our highways. One wrong move, and a car will crush them.  We turned on to Van Ness Avenue, which cuts through downtown. It had been newly paved, and instead of lines on the street, there were little yellow tabs indicating where the lines would eventually go. The Tesla hated this and dodged worriedly right and left, looking for something to anchor it. There were no other cars around, so Alford let it get that out of its system and eventually find a lane line to follow.  ''You build a tolerance to the risks it takes,'' he said. ''Yes, it's swerving all over the place, but I know it's not going to crash into something.'' Still, the experience of the beta had changed the way he approached his own work. ''It's actually made me, as a software developer, more hesitant to put my software in the hands of people'' before it's fully ready, he said, ''even though it's not dangerous.''  Seconds later, we drove through an intersection as two V.R.U.s -- a man walking a dog -- entered the crosswalk. They were a safe distance away, but the dog started to strain against its leash in our direction. Alford and I knew that the pet wasn't in peril because the leash would stop it. But all the Tesla saw was a dog about to jump in front of us, and it came to an abrupt stop. It was a good outcome, all things considered -- no injuries to any life-form -- but it was far from a seamless self-driving experience.  Alford nudged the steering wheel just often enough that the car never warned him to pay attention. He didn't mind the strict driver monitoring: He never tired of studying the car's behavior, so he was never tempted to tune out. Still, he knew people who abused the system. One driver tied an ankle weight to the steering wheel to ''kick back and do whatever'' during long road trips. ''I know a couple of people with Teslas that have F.S.D. beta,'' he said, ''and they have it to drink and drive instead of having to call an Uber.''  We left downtown and got on the highway, headed toward an area northeast of the city called Clovis, where the tricky intersection was. Alford pulled up his F.S.D. settings. His default driver mode was Average, but he said he has found that the two other options -- Chill and Assertive -- aren't much different: ''The car is just really aggressive anyway.'' For highway driving, though, he had the car set to something called Mad Max mode, which meant it would overtake any vehicle in front of him if it was going even a few miles per hour slower than his preferred speed.  We exited the highway and quickly came to a knot of cars. Something had gone wrong with the traffic light, which was flashing red, and drivers in all four directions, across eight lanes, had to figure out when to go and when to yield. The choreography here was delicate: There were too many cars to interweave without some allowances being made for mercy and confusion and expediency. Among the humans, there was a good deal of waving others on and attempted eye contact to see whether someone was going to yield or not.  We crept toward the intersection, car by car, until it was our turn. If we were expecting nuance, there was none. Once we had come to a complete stop, the Tesla accelerated quickly, cutting off one car turning across us and veering around another. It was not so much inhuman as the behavior of a human who was determined to be a jerk. ''That was bad,'' Alford said. ''Normally I would disengage once it makes a mistake like that.'' He clicked a button to send a snapshot of the incident to Tesla.  Later, at a four-way stop, the car was too cautious. It waited too long, and the other two cars at the intersection drove off before we did. We talked about the old saying about safe driving: ''Don't be nice; be predictable.'' For a computer, Tesla's A.I. was surprisingly erratic. ''It's not nice or predictable,'' Alford said.  A few miles down the road, we reached the intersection from the video: a left turn onto East Shepherd Avenue from State Route 168. The traffic light sits right at the point where the city's newest developments end and open land begins. If we drove straight, we would immediately find ourselves surrounded by sagebrush, on the way up into the Sierra.  To replicate the error that Alford uncovered, we needed to approach the intersection with a red left-turn arrow and a green light to continue straight. On our first pass, the arrow turned green at the last second. On the second pass, though, on an empty road, the timing was right: a red for our turn and green for everyone else.  As we got closer, the car moved into the turning lane and started to slow. ''It sees the red,'' I said.  ''No,'' Alford said. ''It always slows down a little here before plowing through.'' But this time, it kept slowing. Alford couldn't believe it. ''It's still going to run the light,'' he said. But he was wrong: We came to a tidy stop right at the line. Alford was shocked. ''They fixed it!'' he said. ''That one I've been giving them an issue about for two years.'' We waited patiently until the light turned green, and the Tesla drove smoothly onto Shepherd Avenue. No problem.  It was as clear a demonstration of Musk's hypothesis as one could hope for. There was a situation that kept stumping the A.I. until, after enough data had been collected by dedicated drivers like Alford, the neural net figured it out. Repeat this risk-reward conversion X number of times, and maybe Tesla will solve self-driving. Maybe even next year.  On the drive back to the center of Fresno, Alford was buoyant, delighted with the possibility that he had changed the Tesla world for the better. I asked him whether the F.S.D. 10.69 release met the hype that preceded it. ''To be honest, yeah, I think so,'' he said. (He was even more enthusiastic about the version of F.S.D. released in December, which he described as nearly flawless.)  A few minutes later, we reached a rundown part of town. Alford said that in general Tesla's A.I. does better in higher-income areas, maybe because those areas have more Tesla owners in them. ''Are there data biases for higher-income areas because that's where the Teslas are?'' he wondered.  We approached an intersection and tried to make a left -- in what turned out to be a repeat of the Laguna Beach scenario. The Tesla started creeping out, trying to get a clearer look at the cars coming from our left. It inched forward, inched forward, until once again we were fully in the lane of traffic. There was nothing stopping the Tesla from accelerating and completing the turn, but instead it just sat there. At the same time, a tricked-out Honda Accord sped toward us, about three seconds away from hitting the driver-side door. Alford quickly took over and punched the accelerator, and we escaped safely. This time, he didn't say anything.  It was a rough ride home from there. At a standard left turn at a traffic light, the system freaked out and tried to go right. Alford had to take over. And then, as we approached a cloverleaf on-ramp to the highway, the car started to accelerate. To stay on the ramp, we needed to make an arcing right turn; in front of us was a steep drop-off into a construction site with no guard rails. The car showed no sign of turning. We crossed a solid white line, milliseconds away from jumping off the road when, at last, the wheel jerked sharply to the right, and we hugged the road again. This time, F.S.D. had corrected itself, but if it hadn't, the crash would have surely killed us.  Peter Thiel, Musk's former business partner at PayPal, once said that if he wrote a book, the chapter about Musk would be called ''The Man Who Knew Nothing About Risk.'' But that's a misunderstanding of Musk's attitude: If you parse his statements, he presents himself as a man who simply embraces astonishing amounts of present-day risk in the rational assumption of future gains.  Musk's clearest articulation of his philosophy has come, of course, on Twitter. ''We should take the set of actions that maximize total public happiness!'' he wrote to one user who asked him how to save the planet. In August, he called the writings of William MacAskill, a Scottish utilitarian ethicist, ''a close match for my philosophy.'' (MacAskill, notably, was also the intellectual muse of Sam Bankman-Fried, though he cut ties with him after the FTX scandal came to light.)  Musk's embrace of risk has produced true breakthroughs: SpaceX can land reusable rockets on remote-controlled landing pads in the ocean; Starlink is providing internet service to Ukrainians on the front lines; OpenAI creeps ever closer to passing the Turing test. As for Tesla, even Musk's harshest critics -- and I talked to many of them while reporting this article -- would pause, unbidden, to give him credit for creating the now-robust market in electric vehicles in the United States and around the world.  And yet, as Robert Lowell wrote, ''No rocket goes as far astray as man.'' In recent months, as the outrages at Twitter and elsewhere began to multiply, Musk seemed determined to squander much of the good will he had built up over his career. I asked Slavik, the plaintiffs' attorney, whether the recent shift in public sentiment against Musk made his job in the courtroom any easier. ''I think at least there are more people who are skeptical of his judgment at this point than were before,'' he said. ''If I were on the other side, I'd be worried about it.''  Some of Musk's most questionable decisions, though, begin to make sense if seen as a result of a blunt utilitarian calculus. Last month, Reuters reported that Neuralink, Musk's medical-device company, had caused the needless deaths of dozens of laboratory animals through rushed experiments. Internal messages from Musk made it clear that the urgency came from the top. ''We are simply not moving fast enough,'' he wrote. ''It is driving me nuts!'' The cost-benefit analysis must have seemed clear to him: Neuralink had the potential to cure paralysis, he believed, which would improve the lives of millions of future humans. The suffering of a smaller number of animals was worth it.  This form of crude long-term-ism, in which the sheer size of future generations gives them added ethical weight, even shows up in Musk's statements about buying Twitter. He called Twitter a ''digital town square'' that was responsible for nothing less than preventing a new American civil war. ''I didn't do it to make more money,'' he wrote. ''I did it to try to help humanity, whom I love.''  Autopilot and F.S.D. represent the culmination of this approach. ''The overarching goal of Tesla engineering,'' Musk wrote, ''is maximize area under user happiness curve.'' Unlike with Twitter or even Neuralink, people were dying as a result of his decisions -- but no matter. In 2019, in a testy exchange of email with the activist investor and steadfast Tesla critic Aaron Greenspan, Musk bristled at the suggestion that Autopilot was anything other than lifesaving technology. ''The data is unequivocal that Autopilot is safer than human driving by a significant margin,'' he wrote. ''It is unethical and false of you to claim otherwise. In doing so, you are endangering the public.''  I wanted to ask Musk to elaborate on his philosophy of risk, but he didn't reply to my interview requests. So instead I spoke with Peter Singer, a prominent utilitarian philosopher, to sort through some of the ethical issues involved. Was Musk right when he claimed that anything that delays the development and adoption of autonomous vehicles was inherently unethical?  ''I think he has a point,'' Singer said, ''if he is right about the facts.''  Musk rarely talks about Autopilot or F.S.D. without mentioning how superior it is to a human driver. At a shareholders' meeting in August, he said that Tesla was ''solving a very important part of A.I., and one that can ultimately save millions of lives and prevent tens of millions of serious injuries by driving just an order of magnitude safer than people.'' Musk does have data to back this up: Starting in 2018, Tesla has released quarterly safety reports to the public, which show a consistent advantage to using Autopilot. The most recent one, from late 2022, said that Teslas with Autopilot engaged were one-tenth as likely to crash as a regular car.  That is the argument that Tesla has to make to the public and to juries this spring. In the words of the company's safety report: ''While no car can prevent all accidents, we work every day to try to make them much less likely to occur.'' Autopilot may cause a crash WW times, but without that technology, we'd be at OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.  Singer told me that even if Autopilot and human drivers were equally deadly, we should prefer the A.I., provided that the next software update, based on data from crash reports and near misses, would make the system even safer. ''That's a little bit like surgeons doing experimental surgery,'' he said. ''Probably the first few times they do the surgery, they're going to lose patients, but the argument for that is they will save more patients in the long run.'' It was important, however, Singer added, that the surgeons get the informed consent of the patients.  Does Tesla have the informed consent of its drivers? The answer might be different for different car owners -- it would probably be different for Dave Key in 2018 than it is in 2022. But most customers are not aware of how flawed Autopilot is, said Philip Koopman, the author of ''How Safe Is Safe Enough? Measuring and Predicting Autonomous Vehicle Safety.'' The cars keep making ''really crazy, crazy, surprising mistakes,'' he said. ''Tesla's practice of using untrained civilians as test drivers for an immature technology is really egregious.''  Koopman also objects to Musk's supposed facts. One obvious problem with the data the company puts",NA

Mr. Easterbrook was ousted for engaging in an inappropriate personal relationship with a McDonald's employee in violation of company policy, the Securities and Exchange Commission said in its order Monday. But the separation agreement with McDonald's concluded that his termination was without cause, which allowed him to keep substantial compensation in McDonald's stock that he otherwise would have forfeited, the agency said.  The S.E.C. said Mr. Easterbrook's separation agreement was valued at more than $40 million.  Mr. Easterbrook told his company at the time that there were no other similar instances. But in July 2020, McDonald's found otherwise. ASSOCIATED PRESS  AUTOMOTIVE  U.S. Safety Regulators Question Musk Tweet  A tweet from Elon Musk indicating that Tesla might allow some owners who are testing a ''Full Self-Driving'' system to disable an alert that reminds them to keep their hands on the steering wheel has drawn attention from U.S. safety regulators.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says it asked Tesla for more information about the tweet. Last week, the agency said the issue is now part of a broader investigation into at least 14 Teslas that have crashed into emergency vehicles while using the Autopilot driver assist system.  Since 2021, Tesla has been beta-testing ''Full Self-Driving'' using owners who haven't been trained on the system but are actively monitored by the company. Earlier this year, Tesla said 160,000, roughly 15 percent of Teslas on U.S. roads, were participating. A wider distribution of the software was to be rolled out late in 2022.  Despite the name, Tesla still says on its website that the cars can't drive themselves.  ASSOCIATED PRESS  AUTOMOTIVE  Rolls-Royce Enjoyed Record Sales in 2022  Rolls-Royce on Monday reported record sales last year despite an average price tag of around $534,000 for its luxury cars and a drop in Chinese demand, with orders stretching into 2023.  The British carmaker, which began as Rolls-Royce in Manchester, England, nearly 120 years ago and is now owned by Germany's BMW, said that it sold 6,021 cars in 2022, up from 5,586 in 2021, which was also a record year.  Rolls-Royce's sales were led by the Americas, with the U.S. comprising around 35 percent of sales. In China, coronavirus-related lockdowns led to a ''single-digit drop'' in sales.  But Torsten Müller-Ötvös, Rolls-Royce's chief executive, said in an online presentation that this decrease was offset by growth in other markets.  Rolls-Royce said that pre-orders for its fully-electric Spectre, due to go on sale at the end of 2023, had exceeded all expectations.

"Document NYTF000020221010eiaa0004n","Business/Financial Desk; SECTB","As Driverless Cars Falter, Driver-Assistance Systems Move to the Fore","By Lawrence Ulrich","1650 words","10 October 2022","The New York Times","NYTF","Late Edition - Final","4",NA,"English","Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.","With investigations and lawsuits over accidents adding skepticism toward fully driverless technology, car companies are betting on systems that take some, but not all, control.  This article is part of our series on the Future of Transportation , which is exploring innovations and challenges that affect how we move about the world.","Imagine heading eastbound on, say, I-95 when you and your pickup encounter red brake lights for miles ahead. Now imagine not touching the brakes or steering wheel and, instead, sitting back and letting the car deal with it.  For the next hour of stop-and-go slog, the truck's system does the driving: anticipating slowdowns, accelerating, braking and steering on its own. When traffic eases up, the pickup climbs to a selected 70-mile-per-hour speed and executes automated lane changes. The system checks blind spots and flashes turn signals.  But this truck isn't designed to be an entirely driverless one. The truck's infrared driver-monitoring camera watches for eye and head position. You can glance at a passenger or consult a navigation screen -- but if you look away for more than a few seconds, LEDs illuminate blue on the steering wheel rim, a transparent command to get your eyes back on the road. If you ignore prompts, the rim flashes red, and the system disengages and reverts to hands-on control.  As Tesla faces a federal investigation and lawsuits over fatal accidents involving its Autopilot system, shaking public confidence in robotic cars, could a pared-down approach like the one described -- variously called ''partial autonomy'' or ''driver assistance'' systems -- be the more realistic future of hands-free driving?  This type of system, more like a no-nonsense chaperone than one you would find in a fully robotic car, is a necessary component for top scores from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's forthcoming ratings of partial-autonomous tech; high ratings from the independent nonprofit are prized. And though General Motors is taking the lead with their Super Cruise system, they not alone; Ford, BMW and Mercedes-Benz are making similar attempts.  Super Cruise combines minutely detailed, 3-D laser-scanned roadway maps with cameras, radar and onboard GPS. By the end of this year, the company intends to expand the system's network to two-way undivided highways for the first time and double its total operational domain to 400,000 miles. Doing so would allow hands-free driving on some of North America's most epic byways, such as the Pacific Coast Highway, Route 66 and the Trans-Canada Highway.  None of this means that car companies are abandoning the dream of fully autonomous cars. In addition to Tesla, G.M.'s Cruise division, Alphabet's Waymo and Argo AI continue to develop and test robotaxis, with human safety operators aboard, in cities including Miami and Austin, Texas. Cruise has begun charging fares for robotaxi rides in modified Chevy Bolt EVs in San Francisco and is mapping Dubai with the hope of starting a robotaxi program there next year.  But as fully driverless technology has faltered, so has faith in such technology. ''The systems work great, right up until they don't,'' said Bryant Walker Smith, an associate professor in the Schools of Law and Engineering at the University of South Carolina, who has advised the federal government on autonomous vehicles. ''We don't have a full sense of the winning combo to cover most of the driving people do.''  In addition, Cruise temporarily halted and recalled its 80-car fleet for a software fix following a two-car collision that injured two occupants in June. A G.M. public filing noted that law enforcement had cited the human-driven car for being mostly at fault, including for speeding, and that the company's robotaxis had, before the collision, safely executed nearly 125,000 left-hand turns through gaps in oncoming traffic.  David Harkey, president of I.I.H.S., said that the industry's reality check over the technical challenges, and attendant public disillusionment, is masking genuine progress. For one, the building blocks of partial autonomy cars are already in every showroom. Automated emergency braking is standard on every new car as of September, thanks to a voluntary agreement forged in 2016 among automakers, I.I.H.S. and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  Such radar- or camera-linked brakes have cut police-reported rear-end collisions by a striking 50 percent, Mr. Harkey of the I.I.H.S. said, according to their research, adding that automated pedestrian braking has reduced the number of car-human collisions by 30 percent versus cars without the feature. And anti-lock brakes; cameras, radar and ultrasonic sensors to manage blind spot and lane departure monitors; and adaptive cruise control have become standard as well.  ''We saw that as beneficial tech, and the same will be true for some new tech. We will continue to push to get more features on more models to save more lives and prevent crashes,'' Mr. Harkey said.  The trick, he said, is to build on that promise, with systems that measurably boost safety but keep human drivers in the loop.  ''These are driver assistance systems, not driver replacement systems. Some consumers don't know the difference,'' he said.  For its part, the I.I.H.S. is testing what it calls ''partial-autonomous'' cars (a different term for ''driver-assisted''). This fall, the nonprofit organization plans to release its first ''Safeguard Ratings'' to help guide consumers and spur the industry to integrate the most effective features.  A top ''Good'' rating will require a driver monitoring system that checks both a driver's gaze and hand position. A driver with a coffee in one hand and an iPhone in the other won't be prepared to retake the wheel. Other criteria include escalating visual, audible or haptic alerts to get a driver's attention, and a fail-safe procedure to safely slow or halt the vehicle if the system is misused or to aid an incapacitated driver. (Super Cruise and some similar systems integrate many of those features.) The I.I.H.S. prefers that systems have drivers initiate any automated lane changes to keep them engaged in the process.  One early study, though, points to potential barriers for driver-assisted tech to achieve that ''Good'' rating. The recent shortage of chips has made it harder for the I.I.H.S. to gather and test relatively newfangled cars and has forced G.M. to temporarily halt installation of Super Cruise. Nonetheless, in a 2020 collaborative survey with M.I.T., the I.I.H.S. found that Volvo S90's system (which lacks driver monitoring) led subjects to drive faster, look away more often and use more hand-held devices, signs of potential driver inattention.  In Germany, Mercedes has begun pushing boundaries with its new Drive Pilot, which legally allows a driver to perform nondriving tasks -- checking email, even watching a movie -- but monitors the driver and alerts when to retake the wheel. I.I.H.S. divides these sorts of systems into levels of automation, from zero (no automation) to five (full automation). Experts see Level 3 (some automation, but with a driver at the ready) as the diciest of the levels, a limbo zone compared with Level 5 cars that are truly robotic. For now, Drive Pilot can operate only on certain highways at speeds up to 37 miles per hour. Mercedes is seeking certification to offer the system in the United States next year.  Taking a different approach in marketing, G.M. and other companies have begun downplaying safety gains and citing reduced driver workloads, especially in wearying commutes and traffic.  ''Owners feel more refreshed, they feel more relaxed, yet they are still attentive,'' Mario Maiorana, the chief engineer at Super Cruise, said.  G.M. engineers say that safe and responsible deployment has guided every decision, including a delayed Super Cruise rollout in 2017, even as the company faced mounting criticism for not keeping pace with Tesla's Autopilot.  The next test is G.M.'s Ultra Cruise, which the company intends to debut on the Cadillac Celestiq, a six-figure electric flagship sedan, late next year. The system is designed to ultimately deliver hands-free driving on 3.2 million miles of roadway -- nearly every inch of paved road in the United States and Canada.  Jason Ditman, Ultra Cruise's chief engineer, said the systems must work with full transparency and consistency to instill confidence among owners and the public.  ''If you think it's hard to get someone to let go of the steering wheel on highways,'' Mr. Ditman said, imagine a snowy country lane or crowded city street.  G.M. says Ultra Cruise will stop and start at traffic lights and stop signs, autonomously follow navigation routes, do close-object avoidance of vehicles and pedestrians, even self-park in driveways. The machine learning system will identify dicey scenarios and upload data to continuously improve performance, and G.M. can remotely shut down use of the system on any road where the company is not confident of performance. G.M. claims the system will eventually handle about 95 percent of driving, aside from complex scenarios such as multilane roundabouts.  Despite high-profile crashes, Prof. Smith believes excessive focus on drawbacks of driver-assistance systems distorts the true crisis: Nearly 43,000 Americans died last year in motor-vehicle crashes, which kill roughly 1.3 million people worldwide annually.  ''At least 100 people will die on U.S. roads today, and we're not going to hear about them,'' he said. ''Chances are that not one will be killed in connection with a driver-assistance system.''

All Rights Reserved.","Sometimes it's better to be safe than first.  I grind my teeth when the metaphor of ''a race'' is used in discussions about self-driving vehicle technology.","Companies developing computer-piloted car technology, including Tesla, the Chinese company Baidu, and Waymo, a sibling company of Google, are regularly described as being in a horse race to make self-driving vehicles ready for widespread use. Some U.S. policy organizations and elected officials talk about America's need to demonstrate ''leadership'' by beating China at autonomous technology.  There are risks to moving too slowly with a technology that could make people's lives better, but we shouldn't uncritically buy the narrative that a technology that will take many years to develop -- and could have both profound benefits and fatal pitfalls -- should be treated as a race.  The danger is that an artificial sense of urgency or a zeal to ''win'' could create unnecessary safety risks, give companies permission to hog more of our personal information and prioritize corporations' self-interest at the expense of the public good.  When you read that a company or country is speeding, rushing, racing or winning in an emerging area of technology, it's useful to stop and ask: Why is it a race at all? What are the potential consequences of this sense of urgency? Whom is this message for?  Most self-driving vehicle technologists now think it may take decades until computer-piloted cars are commonplace. Another month, year or two years might not make much difference, and it's not clear that all races are worth winning.  So why does this narrative about self-driving cars exist? First, companies find it useful to be perceived by their employees, investors, business partners, regulators and the public as having the best shot at making safe, useful and lucrative computer-piloted transportation technology. Everyone wants to back a winner.  Pioneers have a shot at dictating the direction of a new technology and building a network of business allies and users.  But winning a ''race'' in technology isn't always meaningful. Apple wasn't the first company to make a smartphone. Google didn't develop the first online search engine. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company didn't produce the first advanced computer chip. They are technology superstars because they did it (arguably) best, not first.  Second, the ''race'' narrative feels like a cudgel to persuade the public or elected officials to move faster with rules and regulations, justify loose ones or expose people to unnecessary risks to ''win.''  The Wall Street Journal reported last week about concerns that the autonomous trucking company TuSimple was taking safety risks with people's lives ''in a rush to deliver driverless trucks to market.'' The Journal reported that a truck fitted with TuSimple technology veered suddenly on an Arizona interstate last spring and careered into a concrete barricade. TuSimple told The Journal that no one was hurt and that safety was its top priority.  Apple's autonomous test cars have smacked into curbs near the company's Bay Area headquarters, and earlier this year one nearly crashed into a jogger who had the right of way crossing the street, The Information reported last month.  Cars without drivers could eventually make our roads safer, but each of those incidents was a reminder of the threats that these companies pose as they work out the kinks in self-driving vehicles. Developing a streaming video app doesn't kill people.  ''We are letting these companies set the rules,'' Cade Metz, a New York Times reporter who writes about autonomous vehicle technology, told me.  Cade suggested a redefinition of the race narrative. Instead of trying to win at making driverless cars widespread, there could be a race to steer this technology in the public interest, he said.  Characterizing emerging technology as a ''race'' with China isn't great, either. There are advantages if an American company is the first to commercialize a new technology, but it's also dangerous to treat everything as a superpower competition.  In an interview last year with Kara Swisher, who at the time hosted a Times Opinion podcast, the 23andMe chief executive Anne Wojcicki lamented that the U.S. was ''behind'' China in an ''information war that's going on with respect to understanding the human genome.'' Then Swisher asked: ''Is this a war we want to win?''  Good question. If China is collecting mass amounts of people's DNA, does that mean the U.S. should do it, too?  Plus, putting this much focus on driverless cars also may crowd out alternative ideas for improving transportation.  Perhaps the race metaphor we need is from Aesop's fable of the hare and the tortoise. Slowly, steadily, sensibly, with a keen awareness of the benefits and drawbacks -- that is the way to win the self-driving car race. (But it's not a race.)  Are folding phones awesome or awful?  Samsung this week unveiled a new set of foldable phones that combine elements of smartphones and tablets. Brian X. Chen , the consumer technology columnist for The Times, brings us his likes and (mostly) dislikes of foldable phones:  Foldable cellphones are basically smartphones with a hinge to open and close like a book to expand the screen size. Samsung has been refining this technology for years, but I remain generally skeptical about it.  These were my impressions of the pros and cons of earlier models after testing them years ago (starting with the cons):  Cons  When folded up, foldable phones are thicker than a typical smartphone, which adds bulk in your pocket or hand.  The hinge mechanism has a finite life and will eventually need to be replaced. That means in addition to worrying about the eventual death of the battery, you'll need to worry about the hinge.  Though the concept sounds cool, unfolding a phone adds an extra step to unlocking the device and starting to use it. This gets tedious over time.  Pros  For some models, you get more screen than you would on a normal phone. That's pretty much it.  For a similar take: David Pierce, a writer for The Verge, wrote that folding phones seem like a great idea but are annoyingly compromised.  Before we go ...  It's the twilight of Silicon Valley boy bosses: My colleague Erin Griffith reported on why some founders of young technology companies are quitting. Surprise: It's not so fun to run a company when investor money is harder to come by, the economy is rocky, and cost-cutting is cooler than ''vision.'' (Bonus points for the sparkling unicorn illustration.)  Bad government technology is a symptom, not a cause, of dysfunction: The Washington Post has a delightful and infuriating photo essay showing the I.R.S.'s antiquated technology and clunky bureaucracy for processing tax returns. The cafeteria is just a sea of paper. (A subscription may be required.)  Hobby drones go to war: Drones used in combat zones are no longer only large, expensive weapons. Ukraine's military is also using hobbyist drones adapted in makeshift workshops to drop bombs and spot artillery targets, my colleague Andrew E. Kramer reported.

"Document NYTF000020220807ei870002w","Style Desk; SECTST","Is Scott Galloway a Howard Stern for the M.B.A. Set?","By Christopher Beam","3625 words","7 August 2022","The New York Times","NYTF","Late Edition - Final","4",NA,"English","Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.","Scott Galloway sat in his home studio in Delray Beach, Fla., staring off into space, trying to think of a joke to kick off the 164th episode of his podcast, ''The Prof G Show.'' His team of producers waited patiently. After a minute of silence, Mr. Galloway, an N.Y.U. marketing professor and business guru, started a riff about people (like him) born in 1964, including Sandra Bullock. He likened her career to Covid -- it continues but no one seems to care. (Mr. Galloway used saltier language.)  Crickets. ''I need positive reaffirmation,'' Mr. Galloway told his team. ''Were those good?''","Claire Miller, one of this producers, said, ''I think you can do better.'' He tried out a joke about Mary Poppins performing fellatio. ''Not a fan,'' said Caroline Schagrin, another producer. Mr. Galloway attempted one more, about accidentally giving a diabetic friend a spoonful of sugar. After a pause, Ms. Schagrin weighed in: ''We can go with that.''  Then, in a high-speed nasal baritone by way of Venice Beach, Mr. Galloway, 57, went into the meat of his show: a discussion of international money laundering, layoffs at fast-growing companies, and the legal intricacies of Elon Musk's Twitter deal (which at that point seemed more likely to happen).  In any given episode, Mr. Galloway serves a heady cocktail of data-driven analysis, bold-to-brash bets, center-left politics, dirty jokes and sudden emotional vulnerability that appeals to his core audience of men, and helps him stand out in a world of bland talking heads. He's a little like Howard Stern for aspiring M.B.A.s and restless middle managers, offering listeners permission to have feelings and assert mildly politically incorrect opinions. (Fast Company called him a ''progressive Jordan Peterson.'')  His hobbyhorses include the worship of tech founders (we should stop), antitrust regulation (we need more), higher education (costs too much), ''failing young men'' (they need role models), physical fitness (he does CrossFit) and the importance of building personal relationships. He is also apt to take off his shirt, as he did in a promo for a doomed Bloomberg TV show, or put on a wig, as he did at a tech conference while lip-syncing to Adele.  ''He's one of those rare people who cut through,'' said Jeff Zucker, the former president of CNN, who hired Mr. Galloway to host a show on CNN+ before the streaming network shut down in April. ''I don't know if everything he says is right, but he says it in a damn interesting way.''  Mr. Galloway aspires to be ''the most influential thought leader in the history of business,'' he said. Sometimes it seems as if by ''most influential'' he means ''most frequent'': In addition to the main podcast, his company, Prof G Media, produces a weekly newsletter, four podcast episodes a week, YouTube videos, a column for New York magazine and a book every 18 months or so. (The latest, Adrift: America in 100 Charts, will be published in September.)  Plus, he makes regular prime-time TV appearances and teaches brand strategy one semester a year at N.Y.U., along with online courses for his education start-up, Section4. Mr. Galloway, who was already wealthy from selling two companies and taking a third public, also makes more than $5 million a year from speaking gigs, he said, largely from corporations and industry groups that pay him $50,000 (for virtual events) to $250,000 (for international events). ''I should be broken up,'' he joked.  'A Huge White Space for Heterosexual Men to Talk About Their Emotions'  Mr. Galloway got his most meaningful break as a pundit in 2017 when, during an appearance on Kara Swisher's podcast, he predicted that Amazon would acquire Whole Foods. Four days after the episode aired, Amazon announced plans to do just that, and Ms. Swisher, a tech journalist who is a former columnist for The New York Times, soon invited him to host a new podcast with her, ''Pivot.''  ''Literally nobody knew who he was,'' Ms. Swisher said. When she first saw him speak, she thought he was a jerk, she said. ''Then he said something super-friggin' insightful.'' Each episode now gets a quarter-million downloads, according to Mr. Galloway, putting it on the cusp of Apple's top 100 podcasts, in a league with ''The Glenn Beck Program'' and the NPR show ''Wait Wait ... Don't Tell Me!'' He said his newsletter reaches an audience of about 250,000, and ''The Prof G Show'' about half that.  His celebrity has grown along with his audience. In 2019, Mr. Galloway wrote a scathing indictment of WeWork, calling its $47 billion valuation ''seriously loco,'' which set the stage for the collapse of its I.P.O. In the Apple TV+ series ''WeCrashed,'' the actor Kelly AuCoin channels Mr. Galloway -- shiny dome, glasses and all -- as he interrogates Adam Neumann, the WeWork founder (played by Jared Leto), during an event at J.P. Morgan, all of which really happened. ''It was chilling how exact the dialogue was,'' Mr. Galloway said on a podcast.  Mr. Galloway tends to seek out confrontation. At a recent conference for the digital advertising industry, he told the audience that ''most advertising sucks.'' ''The reason I brought him here is to be a provocateur,'' the host Anthony Katsur told me afterward, adding that it's helpful to have Mr. Galloway ''call us out.''  In various forums, he has lately offered blistering opinions on the executives behind the stock trading app Robinhood (''mendacious''), Mark Zuckerberg (''the most dangerous person in the world''), Sheryl Sandberg (she made a fortune by exploiting ''personal loss'' and ''this important conversation around gender balance''), Tesla stock (''My prediction: pain'') and chasing one's dreams (instead, ''make Benjamins'').  But Mr. Galloway also has a willingness -- compulsion, even -- to get personal. He weaves in anecdotes about family, failure and grief. One of his most popular newsletters reflected on the death of his dog. Ms. Swisher described him as an ''open wound.'' Mr. Galloway said his vulnerability amounts to a competitive advantage: ''You fight the enemy with the weapons they can't use.''  ''I can't out-CNBC them,'' he added, ''but I can talk about my kids or my up-and-down relationship with my dad.''  His work often verges on self-help, particular for struggling young men. With a ''Prof G Show'' audience that's three-quarters male, according to Mr. Galloway, he said his imagined listener is a young father who's ''in the thick of it, stressed out, and what I call at the bottom of the smile curve,'' or the U-shaped chart that maps happiness against age. He offers these men ''an emotional outlet,'' he said. (The business talk perhaps gives them cover.)  Mr. Galloway, who cites Muhammad Ali and Richard Simmons as heroes, also models a certain type of masculinity: nerdy but fit, aggressively liberal but not dogmatic, a bro who nonetheless likes a good cry. He believes this kind of man is underrepresented in media: ''I think there's a huge white space for heterosexual men to talk about their emotions,'' he said.  When I asked one listener, Connor Queen, 28, a former sales executive in Idaho, how Mr. Galloway had influenced him, Mr. Queen said he recently started telling his brother that he loves him.  Not everyone enjoys the schtick. The entrepreneur and investor Jason Calacanis, an early backer of Uber and Robinhood, has made Mr. Galloway a regular target of derision on Twitter. Mr. Calacanis chides ''Professor Cold Takes'' for making predictions without having ''skin in the game.'' (''I have a lot of skin in the game,'' said Mr. Galloway, who has investments in Airbnb, Amazon and Apple, among other companies.)  Keith Rabois, another prominent investor, mocked Mr. Galloway on Twitter in 2019 for suggesting that the microblogging company replace Jack Dorsey: Mr. Dorsey and Elon Musk ''can do more in their sleep than Prof Galloway can do 24/7,'' he wrote. Mr. Dorsey resigned as C.E.O. of Twitter in 2021 and left the board of directors this year.  Mr. Rabois described Mr. Galloway in an email to me as ''a buffoon who likes attention.'' (Mr. Galloway said many of his haters are just mad that he has criticized their companies.)  Critics also point out that his predictions often miss, sometimes wildly. In 2015, he speculated that Macy's would beat out Amazon. Macy's has since shed three-quarters of its value, while Amazon's stock has sextupled.  In 2019, Mr. Galloway said that Tesla stock would tank by 80 percent; it has since exploded upward. His forecasts inspired Julie Young, an investor and analyst, to propose an index that invests by betting against Mr. Galloway's predictions. The imaginary ''Anti-Galloway Index,'' albeit based on one set of prognostications and fluctuating wildly in recent months, currently has a return of about 200 percent.  'I Worry My Narcissism Is Getting the Better of Me'  ''I am financially much more secure than I ever thought I would be,'' Mr. Galloway said. ''I still have massive anxiety and fear around it.'' We were sitting on matching leather armchairs in his 3,300-square-foot SoHo apartment with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the cobblestones of what he said is ''supposedly the most Instagrammed street in the United States.''  Despite the bustle outside, the room was nearly silent with the windows closed, as if to complement its clean minimalism -- everything gray scale except for an orange, scroll-like print by the gender-playful British artist Grayson Perry hanging above the dining table.  Mr. Galloway's 11-year-old son lounged on the L-shaped couch, watching European soccer on mute. Mr. Galloway and I sipped protein shakes after a circuit workout at the Equinox around the corner. (Mr. Galloway got his first job out of college, at Morgan Stanley, in part because he was a personal trainer for someone at the firm. Also because, he says, he lied about his grades.) His wife, Beata, 43, a property developer from Germany whom Mr. Galloway first met at a hotel pool, soon arrived to take their son to their seaside mansion in Florida.  Mr. Galloway grew up in Los Angeles to immigrant parents. His father, a charming sales executive raised in Depression-era Scotland, had a ''terrible relationship with money,'' he said. His parents divorced when he was 9, and he lived with his mother, who worked as a secretary.  ''It was an enormous source of stress that we didn't have money,'' he said. ''It was also very emasculating.'' Mr. Galloway became obsessed with money, and bought his first stock (Columbia Pictures) as an eighth grader. He wasn't popular. ''I looked like Ichabod Crane with bad skin,'' he said. In high school, he ran for class president three years in a row, and lost each time. He also developed body dysmorphia, he said.  He went to college at U.C.L.A. and described his time there, in a not-entirely-convincing tone of regret, as a ''missed opportunity to be responsible.'' He joined a fraternity, rowed crew and gained 20 pounds of muscle. ''Quite frankly, my life changed,'' he said. ''All of a sudden women were very interested in me.''  During business school at the University of California, Berkeley, he and a classmate started a firm called Prophet Brand Strategy, advising companies on how to build their brands. This being the early 1990s, their advice often amounted to: Use the internet. They attracted big clients, including Williams-Sonoma, Levi Strauss and Apple. In the dot-com boom, they started a series of companies, including an e-commerce site called RedEnvelope, where people could buy and send last-minute gifts.  RedEnvelope got an influx of cash from venture capital firms, including Sequoia Capital, but Mr. Galloway thought the new financiers were steering the company in a terrible direction. His battle to replace the board failed, but did attract the attention of hedge funds. ''They said, 'We like the cut of your crazy jib,''' he said.  He entered a new phase as an activist investor and started looking for companies to flip, like Gateway and Sharper Image. ''It fit my personality,'' Mr. Galloway said, describing himself with a profane synonym for jerk. In 2008, Mr. Galloway and a partner targeted The New York Times Company, buying nearly 20 percent of the company and securing two seats on its board. (It was a tense relationship, and he stepped down in 2010; Arthur Sulzberger Jr., then the publisher of The Times, declined an interview request made through a spokeswoman for the company.)  His profile began to rise. During the very public Times saga, a reporter from the gossip site Radar Online turned up at a showing of Mr. Galloway's house in the Hamptons and spotted some of his old college photos on the wall. A series of pictures showed Mr. Galloway partying with his frat brothers, with captions that included ''The Vagilantes'' and more crude nicknames.  After that, any time Gawker or the Intelligencer blog (at New York magazine) reported on Mr. Galloway and his dealings with The Times, they used one of those nicknames.  Cable networks starting inviting him on to share his takes. In 2014, to promote his new luxury brand intelligence firm L2, Mr. Galloway started a YouTube series called ''Winners and Losers,'' in which he highlighted companies that did especially well or poorly. The videos were shot in black and white, with Mr. Galloway appearing from the waist up against a white background, wearing what he calls his ''uniform'': Brunello Cucinelli shirt, John Varvatos jacket and chunky Warby Parker glasses.  Mr. Galloway hit his stride when he started calling out big tech companies. In 2015, in a speech at the DLD conference (a tech summit in Munich), he deadpanned that ''Google Glass is not a wearable, it's a prophylactic ensuring that you will not conceive a child, as no one will get near you.'' The speech, Mr. Galloway said, got him a contract for his first book, a jeremiad against big tech called ''The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google.''  Despite his multimedia success, episodic television has proved Galloway-resistant. In 2020, he quit his show on Vice TV after the first few episodes turned out so badly that, he said, his wife cried. (She confirmed that she'd been upset by the quality.) Then, in 2021, Bloomberg TV scrapped his new series after Mr. Galloway shot a teaser in which he appeared shirtless and cracked jokes about one-night stands and erectile dysfunction.  It was a big deal, therefore, when Mr. Zucker called Mr. Galloway last summer and offered him a show on CNN+. In April of this year, a few weeks after the network started, Mr. Galloway's producer called with good news: His show was the service's top weekly program. (A spokeswoman for CNN declined to comment.)  The next morning, Mr. Galloway got a text from Ms. Swisher asking if he was OK. It turned out that CNN's new parent company, Discovery, had decided to shut down CNN+. While his show's cancellation wasn't his fault, this made him 0 for 3. ''The universe is telling me I have a face for podcasting,'' he said. Adding to the stress, his education start-up laid off a quarter of its staff around the same time.  But within days after the shutdown, he said he was already fielding calls from TV networks. ''I worry my narcissism is getting the better of me,'' he said. Despite TV being ''pretty much empty calories'' and ''by far the lowest R.O.I. of any medium I've engaged in,'' he said, ''I keep coming back for more.''  For all his obvious desire for attention, Mr. Galloway said he's an introvert. Indeed, one on one, he can seem distant, avoiding eye contact and often reverting to a monotonous autopilot. Any question you ask, he manages to steer the answer back to one of his talking points, like a jukebox of monologues.  When I first met Mr. Galloway for lunch, at Balthazar in SoHo, he told me that one of his core tenets is atheism. ''I'm one hundred percent convinced I'm going to look into my sons' eyes at some point and know our relationship is coming to an end,'' he said. ''And that's OK.''  Later, as I read through his recent newsletters, I stumbled on a familiar line: ''At some point I'll look into my sons' eyes and know our relationship is coming to an end. And that's OK.''  Is He Cancellation-Proof?  Last November, Mr. Galloway's son came home from school and asked: ''What's a numbskull?'' The day before, Elon Musk had called Mr. Galloway an ''insufferable numbskull'' on Twitter, and some of his son's classmates had brought it up. ''I told him, 'We have a funny little back-and-forth.'''  In fact, Mr. Galloway has been one of Mr. Musk's most vocal antagonists, criticizing him for a host of misdeeds, including manipulating Tesla's stock price (an accusation Mr. Musk denies), calling a private citizen -- a caver who helped with the rescue of Thai schoolboys -- a ''pedo,'' and exploiting tax loopholes (Mr. Musk has denied this as well). Mr. Galloway said that bad behavior by tech executives like Mr. Musk ''triggers'' him, in part because it reminds him of himself. ''I'm disgusted with some of my past behavior,'' he said.  Mr. Galloway remembered one incident that occurred soon after he started L2. He was sitting in a meeting with a couple dozen people, watching a man in his 20s go through a slide presentation. Afterward, Mr. Galloway turned to the presenter and, using harsh language, told him he wasn't making sense and was wasting everyone's time.  Later, Mr. Galloway went to the bathroom and stood next to the young man at the urinals. ''I saw his hand shaking,'' Mr. Galloway said. ''And I thought, Jesus Christ, this guy actually has no control over his motor functions because of what I said to him.'' The incident rattled Mr. Galloway. ''I thought, what's the point of being successful if you make people feel that way?''  Mr. Galloway gives his critics plenty of ammunition. Perhaps most notoriously, he speculated publicly that the GameStop stock frenzy of early 2021 was the result of young men not having enough sex. Julie Young, the financial analyst, called his Twitter thread on the subject ''legitimately insane'': ''If a female commentator were this confident and this wrong this often, she would be destroyed in the media.'' Instead, Netflix approached Mr. Galloway to consult on its GameStop movie script.  Mr. Galloway said he has been criticized for his gender-normative analysis before, sometimes fairly. But he argued that he's always hired and promoted people from underrepresented groups. ''Every C.E.O. of every company I've ever hired except for one has either been gay or a woman,'' he said.  After his keynote speech at South by Southwest in March, an audience member named Christopher Haines confronted him about his proclivity for putting on women's clothing as comic relief, arguing that it perpetuates stereotypes that promote bullying. ''I'm wondering,'' Mr. Haines said, ''as a father of a transgender child, if you would consider retiring your cross-dressing, transphobic presentations?''  Mr. Galloway became uncharacteristically flustered. He worked through his thoughts onstage. ''Regardless of what I think I'm doing, I recognize my privilege may make me ignorant to the impact that you've just outlined,'' he said. ''So, let me cut to the chase: I believe that you are sincere. I will stop.''  Mr. Galloway seemed sincere, too, even if he knew that the moment would make for great TV. The incident closed out the first episode of his CNN+ show.  I asked Ms. Swisher if she worries about Mr. Galloway crossing a line in a way that torpedoes his career. ''Every day,'' she said. But Mr. Galloway seems in some ways immune to cancellation. He runs his own company, and has enough income streams that one or two or even five could dry up and he'd be fine. He'd have to alienate his own audience, who were presumably drawn in by his provocations in the first place.  And if it didn't happen when he endorsed Dr. Mehmet Oz for U.S. Senate, or when he fat-shamed Mr. Musk, or when he applauded the decision by the world governing body for swimming to limit the participation of transgender women in international competition, or when he regularly denounces ''wokistan,'' it's hard to imagine when it will.  In September, Mr. Galloway and his family are moving to London. ''We want our kids to experience a different culture,'' he said. He's currently exploring a new TV project with the BBC. He's leery after his hat trick of TV fiascos, but said he tries not to worry about failure. ''What if this doesn't work? We're all going to be dead,'' he said. ''Well, it's going to be a really public failure. Well, OK, the person you're worried about is going to be dead, and so are you.''

"Document NYTF000020220806ei860004h","Business/Financial Desk; SECTB","California's D.M.V. Accuses Tesla of Falsely Advertising Its Autopilot System","By Kalley Huang and Cade Metz","661 words","6 August 2022","The New York Times","NYTF","Late Edition - Final","4",NA,"English","Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.","A state agency said the electric carmaker had misled the public in describing its driver-assistance service as autonomous.  California's Department of Motor Vehicles has accused Tesla of falsely advertising its driver-assistance technology in two complaints that could affect the company's ability to sell cars in the state.","The agency said Tesla had misled customers by claiming in advertisements that vehicles equipped with its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving Capability programs were autonomous. If the agency's complaints to the state's Office of Administrative Hearings succeed, Tesla's licenses to make and sell vehicles in California could be suspended or revoked.  Tesla ''made or disseminated statements that are untrue or misleading, and not based on facts, in advertising vehicles as equipped, or potentially equipped, with advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) features,'' the agency said in its complaints, which were filed on July 28.  The Los Angeles Times reported earlier on the agency's complaints, which are separate from its review of Tesla's vehicle designs and technological abilities.  Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, and a company lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday evening.  In marketing materials on its website, Tesla said its driver-assistance technology was capable of conducting trips ''with no action required by the person in the driver's seat.'' Despite Tesla's disclaimer that the programs ''require active driver supervision,'' the claim and others were false and misleading, the agency said.  Available since 2015, Autopilot is a system that can steer, brake and accelerate the company's cars on its own. But it is designed mainly for use on highways, and the company's documentation requires drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and take control of the car should the system malfunction.  Its name is borrowed from aviation systems that allow planes to fly themselves in ideal conditions with limited pilot input. With the current system, the car will disengage Autopilot if drivers do not consistently keep a hand on the wheel.  For an additional fee, which may be as high as $12,000, car owners can buy Full Self-Driving, a system that expands the abilities of Autopilot.  For the typical buyer, the added features are minimal. When they are used on city streets, for instance, the car will stop at a red light, but it will not progress after a green light unless the driver intervenes.  In May, Mr. Musk said about 100,000 Full Self-Driving buyers had access to a ''beta'' test version of the service that could navigate city streets more extensively -- while drivers continued to keep their hands on the wheel in case anything went wrong. He also said Full Self-Driving would be ''feature complete'' by the end of the year and available to about a million car owners.  At the end of 2015, the year Autopilot debuted, Mr. Musk began saying Teslas would drive themselves within two years. In the years since, he has repeatedly claimed that such an ability was just a year or two away.  ''There are just so many false dawns with self-driving,'' he said in May. ''You think you have a handle on the problem and then -- nope -- it turns out you just hit a ceiling.''  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the country's leading auto safety regulator, is investigating Autopilot after becoming aware of 35 crashes involving the system, including nine that resulted in 14 deaths. Its investigation covers 830,000 vehicles sold in the United States and will look at Full Self-Driving as well as Autopilot.  Tesla has until next Friday to dispute or otherwise respond to the California Department of Motor Vehicles' accusations.

"Document NYTF000020220804ei840004v","Business/Financial Desk; SECTB","Make $$ on YouTube! (Just Pay Upfront.)","By Nico Grant","1735 words","4 August 2022","The New York Times","NYTF","Late Edition - Final","1",NA,"English","Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.","Scott Mitchell became convinced YouTube would make him rich.  Mr. Mitchell, 33, got the idea last year from videos that promoted courses on how to build so-called cash cow channels, which are often created through a process called YouTube automation.","So he bought one course, then another and another. He also paid for mentorship services. Mr. Mitchell spent around $15,000 on his YouTube venture, encountering stumbling blocks at every stage -- courses that taught him little, freelancers who stole content and audience-growth tactics that got him into trouble with YouTube.  ''I've tried three courses and one expert on the side, and the only thing I got out of it was an empty wallet,'' Mr. Mitchell said.  YouTube automation has led to a cottage industry with online influencers offering tutorials and opportunities for fast money. But, as is often the case with promises of quickly made fortunes in online businesses, the YouTube automation process can be a money pit for aspiring internet entrepreneurs and a magnet for poseurs selling unhelpful services.  It is not difficult to find a video that fits the YouTube automation model, though it is hard to say for certain how many of them have been made. They usually have an unseen narrator and a catchy headline. They share news, explain a topic or offer a Top 10 list about celebrities or athletes. They often aggregate material like video clips and photos from other sources. Sometimes, they run into trouble with copyright rules.  The term ''YouTube automation'' is a bit of a misnomer. It usually means farming out work to freelancers rather than relying on an automated process. It is hardly a new idea and yet one that has recently become more popular. Farming out work allows people to run multiple channels, without the time-consuming tasks of writing scripts, recording voice-overs or editing video. And the process is often pitched as a foolproof way to make cash. To get started, you just need money -- for how-to courses and video producers.  The courses instruct people to find video topics that viewers crave. They are told to hire freelancers from online marketplaces where independent contractors, like Fiverr and Upwork, offer to manage their channels and to produce videos that cost from under $30 to more than $100, depending on freelancers' rates. And that's where many people run into trouble.  Cash cow channels with big audiences can rake in tens of thousands of dollars in monthly ad revenue, while unpopular ones can make nothing. YouTube shares ad revenue with a channel's owner after a channel gets 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of viewership. Monetized channels get 55 percent of the money their videos generate -- that is, if they manage to scratch out that much interest. YouTube declined to comment on the automation process.  Last summer, Mr. Mitchell paid $500 for a course titled ''Tube Mastery and Monetization'' taught by Matt Par, who said he made $30,000 a month on YouTube. He said successful students had earned $20,000 a month.  The course featured videos on different aspects of YouTube automation, including choosing the most lucrative subject matter, outsourcing the work and using keywords to make videos easier to find on YouTube. Mr. Par also explained how YouTube's algorithms worked.  But Mr. Mitchell said the course had gaps -- it lacked information on making high-quality videos with good scripts. He and other students also complained in a private Facebook group that the contents of Mr. Par's course were available for free on his YouTube page.  ''It is basically selling dreams,'' Mr. Mitchell said. Mr. Par did not respond to a request for comment.  Mr. Mitchell, who asked The New York Times to not disclose where he lived, started his first channel, Bounty Lux, about wealth and celebrities, last fall. He paid a freelancer he had found on Fiverr $2,000 for 20 videos. YouTube took down one of those videos, about Dwayne Johnson, that featured content stolen from another channel, prompting a dispute with the freelancer. Bounty Lux did not make money and struggled for viewers, so Mr. Mitchell abandoned it.  He later bought a $1,500 course and spent more than $3,000 to learn from an influencer at Pivotal Media, Victor Catrina. He paid another $3,000 for Mr. Catrina's team to make videos, but, he said, the ideas and scripts were taken from other channels.  After his freelancer went missing for five days, Mr. Mitchell decided to stop investing in the profitless channel. Mr. Catrina said that if he ever discovered any of his teams paraphrasing other people's scripts, he would replace them.  ''I'm nowhere near perfect, and neither is the program,'' Mr. Catrina said. ''And I have openly and happily sent refunds to those who either had financial struggles or considered that the program was not up to their standards.''  Alexandra Fasulo of Fort Myers, Fla., and her cousin spent $20,000 on a YouTube automation program from Caleb Boxx in March 2021. In exchange, Mr. Boxx's team managed a celebrity channel for Ms. Fasulo, 29, and produced videos for more than six months. But there were quality issues, she said, and the videos failed to capture many viewers. Mr. Boxx did not respond to a request for comment. The channel made less than $10 a day, so when it was time to pay for a new batch of videos, she dropped it.  ''That's what makes automation not worth it -- you put a lot of money in upfront,'' Ms. Fasulo said.  Dave Nick, a Serbian creator whose real name is Dejan Nikolic, has promoted YouTube automation since 2019. Mr. Nikolic, 20, appears on camera on three channels, and he said he had four channels with unseen narrators and 12 on YouTube Shorts, a quick-clip competitor to TikTok.  Mr. Nikolic said that he made $1.4 million in 2021, including for his own how-to courses and services, and that he had already racked up $1 million this year. The key was his $995 course, responsible for 70 percent of his income.  ''Not a lot of people have done more than a couple million a year with YouTube automation,'' he said. Online business services is ''how you get to eight figures.''  He said that a number of his students had made five figures a month on YouTube but that he did not have an exact count of how many.  Mr. Nikolic's YouTube videos highlight the money he has made and how much viewers could expect to make themselves. His Instagram account features travel destinations, a Rolex and Porsches as well as passages about building a YouTube business. But Mr. Nikolic said his life was ''not just all glamorous.''  ''I spend almost 15 hours a day on my computer,'' he said.  One key to making money from automated YouTube videos is feeding the internet's obsession with Elon Musk, the tech billionaire.  Jelline Brands of Urk, the Netherlands, started the channel Elon Musk Rewind last fall. Some of its content is incorrect, such as a recent video proclaiming the introduction of a Tesla smartphone. Still, Ms. Brands said it had made $250,000 since it had begun. (The Times was unable to verify the figure.) Her channel included, alongside news, rumors and speculation about upcoming Tesla products.  She also offers a how-to course, and many students of her course have started Musk channels as well, even though she asked them not to. She even competes with her sister, who has a channel devoted to the billionaire.  The business model ''is going downhill because the competition is so fierce,'' said Noah Morris, a coach for Ms. Brands's course, Cash Cow Academy Netherlands.  Ms. Brands began offering courses in December 2020, months after paying $1,000 for a YouTube tutorial she later learned was just a four-page document. She has had 1,700 students, most of whom paid 1,000 euros for her course, she said. Between 100 and 200 of them have told her they are making money on YouTube.  ''I love my work,'' she said. ''I don't even consider it as work. It's like a hobby to me. It's like a game.''  Still, she is not immune to the vagaries of YouTube's algorithms. She said her Musk channel yielded €7,500 a month, down from €50,000, or about $50,000, in November. Her former students have also seen a drop in income, she said. Recently, she created 16 channels in a single week to stabilize her business.  The challenging landscape has even prompted some of Ms. Brands's students to offer their own courses.  Youri van Hofwegen, a 21-year-old Dutch creator who is known online as Youri Automation, said some people had unrealistic expectations about finding YouTube success.  ''They want to pay $200 and make $20,000 by next week,'' he said. ''There is no secret, magic strategy. It's just about putting in the work.''  Courses created problems for Mr. Mitchell. A freelancer in a guru's Facebook group told him to buy moneymaking channels from a companythat accrued fake viewers from bots. Mr. Mitchell gave the freelancer $5,000 to produce around 60 videos, about crypto and making money online.  YouTube quickly stripped one of the channels of its ability to make money. The other struggled for months to find an audience before someone uploaded three pirated videos. YouTube deleted the channel for copyright violations. The freelancer claimed someone else had posted the videos in an act of sabotage.  But Mr. Mitchell has still been considering a loan to buy a $30,000 YouTube channel.  ''It's my last-ditch strategy,'' he said. ''I just need a little more time.'' And Mr. Mitchell may offer a course or a manual of his own, when he figures out what to teach.

All Rights Reserved.","More government intervention will slow tech down. Is that good or bad?  It's clear more than ever that governments will no longer leave technology alone.","Europe mandated standard phone chargers for portable electronics while Texas passed a contested law to restrain social media companies' policing of online speech. Tech companies can count on more changes like those as government minders wade into how they do business and how we use their products.  That most likely means new technologies like driverless cars and facial recognition systems will take longer to spread into the world than they might have. For many tech proponents, more deliberation and oversight will slow invention. For others, that's exactly the point.  I wanted to hash this over in today's newsletter because it's easy to be overwhelmed by (or tune out) all the attempted government regulation. In just the past few weeks, journalists have written about pending congressional bills involving data privacy and tech antitrust; the employment classification of drivers for companies like Uber; multiple countries setting standards about how data can and cannot move around the globe; the Netherlands forcing Apple to revise payment options for dating apps; and two state laws on social media speech.  Those are all the result of a still-evolving rethinking of what had been a relatively laissez-faire approach to tech since the 1990s. With exceptions, the prevailing attitude was that new internet technologies, including digital advertising, e-commerce, social media and ''gig'' employment through apps, were too novel, fringe and useful for governments to constrain them with many rules.  As television and radio did when those mediums were new, many tech companies encouraged light regulation by saying that they were bringing change for the better, elected officials were too plodding and clueless to effectively oversee them, and government intervention would muck up progress.  Just one example: A decade ago, Facebook said U.S. rules that require TV and radio to disclose who is paying for election-related ads shouldn't apply to that company. The U.S. election agency ''should not stand in the way of innovation,'' a Facebook lawyer said at the time.  Those ad disclosures aren't always effective, but after Russia-backed propagandists spread social media ads and free posts to inflame American political divisions in 2016, Facebook voluntarily started to provide more transparency about political ads.  Better laws or ad disclosures probably wouldn't have prevented hostile foreign actors from abusing Facebook to wage information wars in the U.S. or other countries. But the hands-off conventional wisdom most likely contributed to a sense that people in charge of tech should be left alone to do what they wished.  That made it harder for governments to wade in once it was clear that social media was being abused to hurt democracy, that unproven driver-assistance technologies might be dangerous, and that Americans have no control in the land grab for our digital information.  ''We realized that we unleashed these powerful forces and failed to create appropriate safeguards,'' said Jeff Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. ''We simply could have said in the beginning, every technology needs to be regulated in a common-sense way.''  Now regulators are feeling empowered. Lawmakers have waded in to make rules for law enforcement's use of facial recognition technology. There will be more laws like those in Texas to take power away from the handful of tech executives who set rules of free expression for billions of people. More countries will force Apple and Google to remake the app economy. More regulation is already changing the ways that children use technology.  Again, not all of this will be good government intervention. But there are more signs that people who create technologies want more government oversight, too -- or at least pay lip service to it. Any discussion about emerging technology, including the artificial intelligence illustration software Dall-E and cryptocurrency, regularly includes deliberation about the potential harms and how regulation might minimize them.  That doesn't mean that people agree on what government oversight should look like. But the answer is almost never no government intervention at all. And that's different.

"Document NYTF000020220609ei690003g","Business/Financial Desk; SECTB","How Safe Is Autopilot? No One Knows.","By Cade Metz","1452 words","9 June 2022","The New York Times","NYTF","Late Edition - Final","1",NA,"English","Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.","Automakers and technology companies say they are making driving safer, but verifying these claims is difficult.  Every three months, Tesla publishes a safety report that provides the number of miles between crashes when drivers use the company's driver-assistance system, Autopilot, and the number of miles between crashes when they do not.","These figures always show that accidents are less frequent with Autopilot, a collection of technologies that can steer, brake and accelerate Tesla vehicles on its own.  But the numbers are misleading. Autopilot is used mainly for highway driving, which is generally twice as safe as driving on city streets, according to the Department of Transportation. Fewer crashes may occur with Autopilot merely because it is typically used in safer situations.  Tesla has not provided data that would allow a comparison of Autopilot's safety on the same kinds of roads. Neither have other carmakers that offer similar systems.  Autopilot has been on public roads since 2015. General Motors introduced Super Cruise in 2017, and Ford Motor brought out BlueCruise last year. But publicly available data that reliably measures the safety of these technologies is scant. American drivers -- whether using these systems or sharing the road with them -- are effectively guinea pigs in an experiment whose results have not yet been revealed.  Carmakers and tech companies are adding more vehicle features that they claim improve safety, but it is difficult to verify these claims. All the while, fatalities on the country's highways and streets have been climbing in recent years, reaching a 16-year high in 2021. It would seem that any additional safety provided by technological advances is not offsetting poor decisions by drivers behind the wheel.  ''There is a lack of data that would give the public the confidence that these systems, as deployed, live up to their expected safety benefits,'' said J. Christian Gerdes, a professor of mechanical engineering and co-director of Stanford University's Center for Automotive Research who was the first chief innovation officer for the Department of Transportation.  G.M. collaborated with the University of Michigan on a study that explored the potential safety benefits of Super Cruise but concluded that they did not have enough data to understand whether the system reduced crashes.  A year ago, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the government's auto safety regulator, ordered companies to report potentially serious crashes involving advanced driver-assistance systems along the lines of Autopilot within a day of learning about them. The order said the agency would make the reports public, but it has not yet done so.  The safety agency declined to comment on what information it had collected so far but said in a statement that the data would be released ''in the near future.''  Tesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, did not respond to requests for comment. G.M. said it had reported two incidents involving Super Cruise to NHTSA: one in 2018 and one in 2020. Ford declined to comment.  The agency's data is unlikely to provide a complete picture of the situation, but it could encourage lawmakers and drivers to take a much closer look at these technologies and ultimately change the way they are marketed and regulated.  ''To solve a problem, you first have to understand it,'' said Bryant Walker Smith, an associate professor in the University of South Carolina's law and engineering schools who specializes in emerging transportation technologies. ''This is a way of getting more ground truth as a basis for investigations, regulations and other actions.''  Despite its abilities, Autopilot does not remove responsibility from the driver. Tesla tells drivers to stay alert and be ready to take control of the car at all times. The same is true of BlueCruise and Super Cruise.  But many experts worry that these systems, because they enable drivers to relinquish active control of the car, may lull them into thinking that their cars are driving themselves. Then, when the technology malfunctions or cannot handle a situation on its own, drivers may be unprepared to take control as quickly as needed.  Older technologies, such as automatic emergency braking and lane departure warning, have long provided safety nets for drivers by slowing or stopping the car or warning drivers when they drift out of their lane. But newer driver-assistance systems flip that arrangement by making the driver the safety net for technology.  Safety experts are particularly concerned about Autopilot because of the way it is marketed. For years, Mr. Musk has said the company's cars were on the verge of true autonomy -- driving themselves in practically any situation. The system's name also implies automation that the technology has not yet achieved.  This may lead to driver complacency. Autopilot has played a role in many fatal crashes, in some cases because drivers were not prepared to take control of the car.  Mr. Musk has long promoted Autopilot as a way of improving safety, and Tesla's quarterly safety reports seem to back him up. But a recent study from the Virginia Transportation Research Council, an arm of the Virginia Department of Transportation, shows that these reports are not what they seem.  ''We know cars using Autopilot are crashing less often than when Autopilot is not used,'' said Noah Goodall, a researcher at the council who explores safety and operational issues surrounding autonomous vehicles. ''But are they being driven in the same way, on the same roads, at the same time of day, by the same drivers?''  Analyzing police and insurance data, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a nonprofit research organization funded by the insurance industry, has found that older technologies like automatic emergency braking and lane departure warning have improved safety. But the organization says studies have not yet shown that driver-assistance systems provide similar benefits.  Part of the problem is that police and insurance data do not always indicate whether these systems were in use at the time of a crash.  The federal auto safety agency has ordered companies to provide data on crashes when driver-assistance technologies were in use within 30 seconds of impact. This could provide a broader picture of how these systems are performing.  But even with that data, safety experts said, it will be difficult to determine whether using these systems is safer than turning them off in the same situations.  The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group for car companies, has warned that the federal safety agency's data could be misconstrued or misrepresented. Some independent experts express similar concerns.  ''My big worry is that we will have detailed data on crashes involving these technologies, without comparable data on crashes involving conventional cars,'' said Matthew Wansley, a professor the Cardozo School of Law in New York who specializes in emerging automotive technologies and was previously general counsel at an autonomous vehicle start-up called nuTonomy. ''It could potentially look like these systems are a lot less safe than they really are.''  For this and other reasons, carmakers may be reluctant to share some data with the agency. Under its order, companies can ask it to withhold certain data by claiming it would reveal business secrets.  The agency is also collecting crash data on automated driving systems -- more advanced technologies that aim to completely remove drivers from cars. These systems are often referred to as ''self-driving cars.''  For the most part, this technology is still being tested in a relatively small number of cars with drivers behind the wheel as a backup. Waymo, a company owned by Google's parent, Alphabet, operates a service without drivers in the suburbs of Phoenix, and similar services are planned in cities like San Francisco and Miami.  Companies are already required to report crashes involving automated driving systems in some states. The federal safety agency's data, which will cover the whole country, should provide additional insight in this area, too.  But the more immediate concern is the safety of Autopilot and other driver-assistance systems, which are installed on hundreds of thousands of vehicles.  ''There is an open question: Is Autopilot increasing crash frequency or decreasing it?'' Mr. Wansley said. ''We might not get a complete answer, but we will get some useful information.''

"Document NYTF000020220422ei4m00056","Business/Financial Desk; SECTB","With an Electric S.U.V., Lotus Trades 'Lightness' for Heft","By Brett Berk","1649 words","22 April 2022","The New York Times","NYTF","Late Edition - Final","5",NA,"English","Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.","The boutique British carmaker, known for lightweight sports cars more than supermarket runs, is planning to expand production substantially as it goes fully electric.  It is not a lithe, analog sports car or racer, powered by gasoline -- making it an outlier among nearly all the 131 Lotus vehicles that preceded it.","Known internally at Lotus, the boutique British carmaker, as the Type 132 and to consumers as the Eletre, it also does not adhere to the company's ethos, as stated by the founder Colin Chapman: ''Simplify, then add lightness.''  Instead, it is a big, battery-powered sport utility vehicle, with a spacious back seat, ''semiautonomous'' driver assistance technology and myriad LCD screens. Late last month, at the BBC Television Centre in London, Lotus unveiled what may be the most unconventional vehicle in its 74-year oddball history.  ''I can guarantee that Type 132 will be the heaviest Lotus we've ever done,'' said Matt Windle, the company's managing director and a former engineer and executive at Tesla and the electric vehicle start-up Zenos. ''But even in that category, we're looking for opportunities to save weight. So it's going to be a heavy Lotus, but it will be on the lighter side of other products out there.''  Lotus would not provide weight figures for the Eletre, which is expected to be priced around $130,000. But competitors like the Audi e-Tron S.U.V., with their heavy lithium-ion batteries, weigh nearly three tons, or about four times Lotus's famed 1962 Elan/Type 26.  As a midsize S.U.V., a sales leader in the global car market, the Eletre is important to Lotus's future. But it is just one component in its new-product onslaught, financed by the marque's latest investors: A 49 percent share is owned by Etika Automotive, a Malaysian company, and the 51 percent controlling stake is held by the Chinese automotive conglomerate Geely, which also owns Volvo.  ''We have six cars going into production in the next five years,'' Mr. Windle said.  These vehicles include the Emira, a $77,000 sports coupe and the brand's final gasoline-powered model, and the Evija, a $2 million-plus, all-electric supercar, both of which will commence production this spring in new facilities at the brand's headquarters in Hethel, England. The Eletre will be built at a factory in China starting at the end of this year.  A midsize electric sedan (Type 133) is poised to follow in 2023. A more compact electric S.U.V. (Type 134) is expected in 2024. And a fully electric sports car (Type 135) is planned for 2026.  These cars are crucial to Lotus's ''Vision 80'' strategy, named for the brand's 80th anniversary, which arrives in 2028. ''The mission statement is to transform us into a global premium performance car brand, taking us from niche sports cars into significant volumes, globally, with products that are innovative, bring us into new markets and new segments, and generally grow the brand across the globe,'' Mr. Windle said.  Lotus's goal is to be selling 100,000 vehicles, annually, worldwide by 2028. This is a lofty target. In 2021, the brand sold just 1,701. Another esteemed and long-lived sports car maker, Maserati, has had similar sales targets during the past decade, with deep-pocketed investment and expanded products. Last year, Maserati delivered just over 24,000 cars.  Moreover, this is not the first time Lotus has promised a major expansion. In 2010, under the leadership of Dany Bahar, a former Ferrari executive, the brand unveiled five new cars and promised they would be in production in five years. Accusations of financial impropriety by Mr. Bahar, and dueling lawsuits, ensued. None of these cars materialized.  Mr. Windle distinguishes the brand's current situation from that one. ''I think in that era, they were trying to sell a plan to go and get investment,'' he said. ''In this era, we have the investment, we have the plan, and then we'll go and talk about it afterward.'' He added that Lotus had ''a 10-year strategy that is fully invested.''  This heavy stake is unfamiliar for the brand. ''Lotus has always been just shy of bankruptcy,'' said Ross Robbins, a 78-year-old retired businessman, marque historian and author, and member of Lotus Limited, among the oldest and largest of the brand's American affinity groups. ''Even when Chapman was there in the early days, they never had enough capital, and they ricocheted from disaster to disaster.''  Yet this resource poverty catalyzed some of the scrappy company's achievements. ''They've always bootstrapped stuff,'' yielding cars that were advanced and innovative and that punched above their weight, Mr. Robbins said. ''But they're fragile, and not for a person who wasn't pretty well versed in mechanical things, because they need a lot of attention.''  Loving something that consistently fails is a perverse compulsion common to many owners of temperamental cars. So it follows that Lotus maintains an extremely engaged owner group.  ''People who have had a Lotus in their past, or currently have a Lotus, are very devoted to it,'' Mr. Robbins said. ''It's not a dalliance with Lotus. You get sucked in. And it just becomes a part of who you are.''  This avidity leads to another challenge for the brand. Might this affection diminish with an all-electric lineup, since battery-powered cars have far fewer moving parts and require far less maintenance than gasoline-powered ones? Or might the notoriously finicky electrical systems in British vehicles bedevil these vehicles with compounded gremlins?  Moreover, as it aims to expand its sales nearly a hundredfold, will Lotus's position as a small-scale manufacturer -- beloved by a passionate, protective and nearly evangelical cohort of automotive cognoscenti -- cause it to lose what has long made it special?  ''Because Lotus is a boutique brand, consumers feel like they're getting a little bit of something else,'' said Alexander Edwards, president of Strategic Vision, an automotive research and consulting firm. ''Most people that are familiar with exotic or ultraluxury brands, they know Lamborghini, they know Ferrari. Lotus is a little different.  ''If you're an owner, you're part of this secret, cool, handshake club that very few people are aware of, and it provides a little extra prestige.''  This status could include special first-name treatment at the dealership, insider acknowledgment from car fanatics (including the automotive press, where Lotus ownership is worn like a badge of honor) and association with the brand's starring roles in notable films. These include James Bond's car-cum-submarine in ''The Spy Who Loved Me,'' Richard Gere's pickup in ''Pretty Woman'' and Number Six's car in the cult 1960s BBC series ''The Prisoner.''  However, according to Mr. Edwards's research, this cachet is not the primary reason that people purchase a Lotus. Lotus buyers -- even more than those who buy Lamborghinis and Ferraris -- are mainly seeking optimal performance, as well as a ''merging of the driver and the machine to create their fantasy mobility experience,'' a condition he likens to the synergy between Batman and the Batmobile.  Because the insider status is not at the core of its consumers' decision, Mr. Edwards said, the brand's risks in becoming significantly larger ''can be easily managed, and even relegated to unimportant.''  He cites Tesla as an example of an insider brand that expanded readily without losing its appeal. ''Yes, there was some sort of specialness initially,'' he said, noting the innovation, exclusivity and six-figure prices of its first offerings, the Roadster and the Model S. ''But if we see how that has evolved to today, nobody really seems to care about the uniqueness of the Tesla when it comes to nobody else having one, because that isn't the primary reason why they were buying. They were buying for technology and performance. And they're still getting that.''  If Mr. Robbins is any example of the faithful undergoing conversion, this thesis may be correct. ''The only reason Lotus hasn't become a more full-line manufacturer like everybody else, and built an S.U.V. to pay the bills, is they never had the capital. Now they do. So I think that's a good thing,'' he said.  ''And I think Matt Windle is exactly there,'' he added. ''I think he's going to do a great job. He understands the brand. He understands the heritage.''  As it turns out, being a relatively unknown carmaker with reverential brand association is a bonus as the market shifts to electrification. According to Mr. Edwards, as more mainstream luxury brands like BMW, Audi and Mercedes-Benz enter the E.V. market, they are likely to siphon off buyers from less established start-ups like Lucid, or even from Tesla, attracting customers who want the security and experience of a more venerable brand for their first electric car.  ''For Lotus, it's an open playing field, and they have a lot of room to navigate this reintroduction to this brand,'' Mr. Edwards said. ''The one thing they absolutely need to do is convince people why Lotus is really a leader in this performance and connected vehicle experience. If they do that right, they will have magnified success.''

All Rights Reserved.","A few years ago, Jon Knope was standing in a rainy parking lot littered with smashed soda bottles in Cartersville, Ga., learning the finer details of how to park a Class 8 combination tractor-trailer. He was in his early 20s, somewhat rootless, and needed a job that would beat hustling on ride share apps in his mother's station wagon.  He liked driving fine, so he went through trucking school. He could make a lot more money, largely because he was allowed to work much more than Uber or Lyft would let him. In the next few years, he would spend more than 900 nights on the road, drive at least 350,000 miles, and, while he was technically alone in his truck cab watching every sunrise and sunset fly by, he was never really by himself. While many associate trucking with freedom, he was, like every trucker, hemmed in by low wages, long hours and an unbelievable level of automation and surveillance.","Today, long-haul truckers are some of the most closely monitored workers in the world. Cameras and sensors dot their trucks, watching the road, the brakes and even the driver's eye movements. Once, when his truck's cabin heater broke, Mr. Knope was forced to sleep in freezing temperatures for several days while traveling across northern Ohio and New York because an automated system made sure his engine was turned off at night. The company told him there was no way to override the system.  Just imagine finishing 10 hours at a desk job, only to return to your apartment to find the heat didn't work. That'd be quite frustrating. Then imagine your apartment was your office and most nights dinner was a microwaveable burrito or a bag of fast food. And then imagine your desk job required you regularly press a little pedal, you couldn't stand up, you had essentially no face-to-face contact with co-workers, and if a bathroom didn't easily present itself you were forced to use a plastic jug -- all while a computer or a person at a desk hundreds of miles away monitors your every move.  Trucking is a supremely dangerous job, with large trucks involved in 10 percent of fatal crashes in the United States in 2019. Mr. Knope often described tractor-trailers as ''40 tons of death.'' One wrong move and your truck could easily kill the family in the minivan next to you. Much of the surveillance truckers experience is in the name of safety, and truckers agree that safety is paramount.  However, experts say the fatigue that leads truckers to be unsafe -- to fall asleep at the wheel or lose focus -- is a direct result of low wages that encourage drivers to spend too much time on the road. While we often think of automation and A.I. as developments that will eventually replace workers (think of Tesla's partly automated tractor-trailer), those tools are already in heavy use in the workplace. And they haven't replaced workers; they've simply been brought in to manage declining working conditions.  While journalists tracked the Canadian trucker protest as it radiated out from Ottawa, becoming a worldwide movement adopted and amplified by conservative politics, few asked why it was truckers specifically who started the movement when plenty of other workers in Canada and the United States had already been subject to vaccine mandates. And yet there were warnings that truckers would rebel.  The American Trucking Associations, a major industry trade group, noted last October that truckers were likely to cause supply chain disruptions if subjected to a vaccine mandate. They already experience the extreme end of workplace control, diminishing wages and an intense lack of privacy, and ultimately a vaccine mandate pushed more than a few of them over the edge.  Ask almost anyone what's wrong with trucking -- drivers, transportation economists, advocacy groups -- and they'll all begin with one number: the extraordinarily high turnover rate.  For decades, truckers have quit at alarming rates, leading to a chronic shortage. The turnover rate was at a staggering 91 percent in 2019, which means that for every 100 people who signed up to drive, 91 walked out the door. Plenty of people have the commercial driver's licenses needed to operate trucks, said Michael Belzer, a Wayne State University economist who has studied the industry for 30 years. ''None of them will work for these wages,'' he added. Studies even show that their pay, when adjusted for inflation, has declined markedly since the 1970s.  It wasn't always like this, said Jerry Fritts, a retired long-haul trucker from Memphis who started full-time in the field in 1966. Trucking used to be a good job, with union representation, decent pay and benefits, and normal hours.  ''There used to be only three ways that you got a trucking job,'' he told me. ''Someone retired, was killed on the job, or died.'' Few quit. I asked Mr. Fritts how he landed his position at a national trucking firm and he told me that he simply received a call one day in 1969 from someone who told him, ''Scotty just got killed.''  Before deregulation during the Carter administration, trucking was an industry with high union representation. But fears of inflation pushed the government to allow less regulated, nonunionized firms to compete with the unionized common carriers. That effectively took the bottom out of the labor market, and as companies raced to offer the lowest rates to customers, wages were squeezed. Working conditions and pay cratered, and truckers fled.  To compensate for low wages, some truckers now work dangerously long hours, the average trucker well over 60 hours a week. Many truckers report working 100 hours or more each week. This is in part because truckers are not actually paid for all the time they spend working. They're almost always paid by the mile.  So if Mr. Knope were to show up to, say, a pet food warehouse, exhausted from a day of driving, looking to unload quickly, find something to eat and catch some sleep, the warehouse staff might tell him there wasn't anyone available to unload his truck for six hours, and he would be forced to wait, lonely in his truck, paid for only part of the time he spent waiting. (Other trucking companies might not compensate their drivers at all.)  Working more, and driving more, leads to endemic exhaustion, a problem so well known that companies deploy a bevy of ''fatigue management'' technologies and automated collision avoidance systems, Karen Levy, a sociologist at Cornell, told me. These tools monitor the drivers with that bevy of cameras and sensors.  Many companies now even have software programs that can review camera footage and detect whether a driver had his eyes on the road. At some companies, you can be fired if you are caught looking at your phone, even if it was just to change your podcast.  Mr. Belzer said that mandating that truckers be paid for their time, not just the miles they log, would be a step toward getting them to work a safer 40-hour week -- and it might even help companies retain workers by ensuring that they can make it home to see their families more than a few times a month.  When I asked Mr. Knope and Mr. Fritts whether they were surprised that truckers had started the protest movement in Ottawa, neither was. ''Trucking has been a keg of dynamite waiting to explode for 39 years,'' Mr. Fritts said. ''I'm surprised it took this long.''  In some ways the story of a trucker rebellion in reaction to a government mandate is odd because truckers, particularly the ones who drive the long-distance freight routes between the United States and Canada, are some of the most highly monitored and regulated workers in the world. Just to get a job interview, Mr. Knope told me, he had to submit to a blood pressure test and urinalysis. But of all the tests and monitoring that violate their privacy and diminish their autonomy, the vaccine mandate just so happens to have a radioactive political valence. For many truckers, it was the straw that broke the camel's back.  ''It's a lightweight straw,'' Mr. Knope said, ''but it's also a very encumbered camel.''

"Document NYTF000020220206ei2600042","Sunday Review Desk; SECTSR","Help. I've Fallen for the Cadillac Escalade.","By Farhad Manjoo","1720 words","6 February 2022","The New York Times","NYTF","Late Edition - Final","7",NA,"English","Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.","I was not prepared to fall head over heels for the Cadillac Escalade. It's not my kind of car -- or, at least, it's not supposed to be. The Escalade is one of the largest, heaviest, least efficient and most expensive S.U.V.s on the road. It is also among the most unembarrassedly decadent, the ride of choice for Manhattan bigwigs and reality-TV housewives, the sort of car that rappers, movie stars and professional athletes buy for their mothers after making it big.  Aesthetically, financially, environmentally and perhaps even morally, everything about the Escalade felt poorly suited to someone like myself, the bookish newspaper columnist who frequently rails against the cultural dominance of cars and so on.","And yet here I sit, pining for the 2021 Escalade in Dark Moon Blue Metallic that I drove during a two-week, 2,400-mile family road trip through Arizona and Nevada over the winter holiday.  I'd chosen this Escalade because it's emblematic of a trend sweeping car design: It has been stuffed to the gills with technology. Among other things, much of the dashboard is composed of a sweeping, 38-inch curved touch-screen display. The stereo system has 36 speakers. Cameras mounted pretty much everywhere allow you to pull up views of the car from every angle. Microphones set around the car can amplify voices through the speakers, creating a kind of in-car intercom.  These many tech-enabled comforts and conveniences turn the Escalade into something more couch than conveyance. I imagine cars like it functioning as a kind of third space in the daily routines of the upper middle class -- a very nice home theater, home office or den that happens to be on wheels. Plus, sometimes, it can pretty much drive itself.  I fell for these digital charms. I have driven many faster and more fun cars than the Escalade. I have definitely driven cheaper and more practical cars. But I have never been in a car that makes being stuck in a car as comfortable and effortless as this one.  The market seems to agree: The Escalade's tech-heavy 2021 redesign sent sales surging by 65 percent. Escalades start at around $80,000, but after piling on upgrades, nearly half of the owners spend over $100,000. The one I drove, which The New York Times paid to rent from a fleet management company that handles G.M.'s press-review cars -- and which had most but not all available options -- carried a sticker price of nearly $109,000.  But mine is a troubled love, a guilty love, a love whose implications confuse and alarm me. The digital transformation of cars won't stop with luxury S.U.V.s. Many of the features that I found so compelling in the Escalade will eventually make their way to its lower-priced Chevrolet cousins, the Tahoe and Suburban, and probably to every other car.  What's so terrible about that? I have argued before that we can't solve problems caused by cars -- among them climate-warming emissions -- simply by building better cars. Research has shown that even with more efficient electric cars, Americans will have to drive much less and walk, bike and ride transit much more in order to meet climate goals.  The Escalade's comforts defeat that goal; many times, I found myself driving more, longer, because driving the Escalade was so totally easy. If most cars become as comfortable, convenient and luxurious as this one -- while growing ever larger -- what hope is there that we might ever reduce our dependence on these monstrous machines? Also, should I plan to lease or to buy?  To see why I'm so taken with the Escalade, let me tell you about Super Cruise, G.M.'s autonomous driving system, which is among the industry's most advanced. Many cars now offer some version of driving assistance, but most manufacturers' self-driving systems, even Tesla's Autopilot, require the humans sitting in the driver's seats to keep their hands on the steering wheel while the car is piloting itself. Super Cruise dispenses with the wheel touching.  After engaging the system, you can twiddle your toes and put your hands in the air like you just don't care. The car will steer, stay centered in a lane and adjust its speed to keep pace with the traffic around you (up to a set maximum speed). When you tap the turn signal, it will search for a safe spot and change lanes. Sometimes the car encounters a problem (for instance, the road's lane lines are too faint for it to pick out), and it informs you to take over.  The car does not navigate by itself -- that is, it won't follow a route to an address -- so you've got to enter and exit the freeway manually. But if you're going to be on one road for a long while, you can turn it on and, for the most part, do nothing while it keeps chugging.  All the car asks is that you keep looking forward, in the general direction of the road. A small camera mounted on the steering column watches you to make sure. If you look away for more than a few seconds or cover or block your eyes while eating, reading, texting and the like, the car will issue a series of warnings for you to pay attention. If you fail to heed the warnings, the car will eventually disengage Super Cruise and begin to slow down. Ignoring it isn't easy; there are angry red lights, a buzzer in your seat, a stern voice scolding you, and I, for one, was quick to obey.  Super Cruise's main limitation is geographic. Unlike Tesla's system, which can be activated on pretty much any road, Super Cruise can be engaged only on the few hundred thousand miles of American roadway that G.M. has mapped. In practice, this means it works on most state and Interstate highways. I wasn't keeping track, but I'd estimate it was available on about two-thirds of our trip.  The system takes some getting used to; there's a bit of nervousness the first few times you turn it on -- you keep your hands on the wheel just to be sure that it's really driving -- but it wasn't long before I began to trust it.  What does one do in the driver's seat, if not drive? It's basically like being a passenger. For dozens of miles at a time, the car asks nothing from you. Freed from the drudgery of driving, you can let your eye wander across the scenery and your mind contemplate the mundane and the profound. It's not that you're completely distracted -- even lost in thought, you can keep situational awareness of the road ahead -- but the reduction in stress is significant. With Super Cruise, I could drive much farther in a day and feel much calmer afterward, almost as if I hadn't done anything at all.  What all of this amounts to, after a while, is an inflated sense of confidence, a feeling that your car can take you anywhere more or less hassle-free. Super Cruise let me drive farther than I could otherwise, with less stress. (And the Escalade's many screens let my kids sit longer in the car than they would have otherwise, with less whining. My son, who's 11, spent much of the trip playing Xbox on the back-seat display.)  A snowstorm rolled in when we were in Los Alamos, N.M., and if I'd been in another car, I would probably have waited for the snow to pass before I set off out of town. But the Escalade had me hopped up: Because I suspected self-driving in the snow would not be all that much more of an annoyance than self-driving in clear weather, I'd chosen to keep driving in potentially dangerous conditions.  This is exactly the sort of thinking that urban scholars say promotes sprawl. America's first wave of urban sprawl, which took off after World War II, was fueled in part by the plummeting price of cars and the development of the Interstate highway system. The artificial intelligence researcher Carlos Ignacio Gutierrez argues in a recent paper that autonomous cars can produce a similar effect: If self-driving an hourlong commute is as easy as manually driving a half-hour commute, an owner of a self-driving car may reasonably decide to move to more affordable housing farther from city centers. And moving farther away -- that is, creating sprawl -- intensifies car dependence by making alternative forms of transportation like walking or biking more difficult.  At this point this is only a theory, but it's a plausible one. Some research has already shown that people who use advanced driver-assistance systems drive more than those who don't.  And self-driving systems will keep getting better. G.M. has announced an update that will be available on some 2023 vehicles that will ''enable hands-free driving in 95 percent of all driving scenarios.''  But how far does this go? As the cars get better at driving themselves, as the screens get bigger and the speakers louder and the seats more comfortable, what role will cars come to play in our lives? They might become our new living rooms. They could also become our very luxurious prisons.  Office Hours With Farhad Manjoo  Farhad wants to chat with readers on the phone .

"Document NYTF000020220103ei130003x","Business/Financial Desk; SECTB","Tesla Delivered 87% More Cars in 2021, or 936,000","By Neal E. Boudette","825 words","3 January 2022","The New York Times","NYTF","Late Edition - Final","2",NA,"English","Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.","The electric-car maker managed substantial growth as Europe and China increasingly propelled sales.  Tesla reported Sunday that it delivered 936,000 cars in 2021, an 87 percent increase from the year before, despite the computer chip shortage that has disrupted auto production around the world.","In the fourth quarter alone, the company delivered more than 308,000 vehicles, a 71 percent increase from the quarter a year earlier. The overwhelming share of the deliveries were of the Model 3 sedan and the Model Y hatchback. Wall Street analysts had been expecting deliveries of about 266,000 cars in the fourth quarter, and about 855,000 for the year.  ''The numbers are hard to poke holes in,'' Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note to investors. ''While there are many competitors in the E.V. space, Tesla continues to dominate market share as evidenced again this quarter.''  Tesla increased sales despite a global shortage of computer chips, which serve as the brains for a variety of electronics, including engine controllers and touch screens. The shortage forced most automakers to idle some plants for weeks at a time and kept them from producing as many vehicles as they had planned.  In July, Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, said his company was overcoming the shortage by switching to types of chips that were more readily available and writing new instructions, or firmware, to be embedded into the chip. Tesla can make such a switch because the components in its cars are designed to be controlled largely by software.  Tesla does not break out its deliveries by country. Much of its recent growth has been propelled by sales in Europe and China.  The jump in deliveries capped a momentous year in which Tesla's stock price and profits soared. It has also worked to open factories near Austin, Texas, as well as Berlin, in hopes of sustaining its rapid growth.  In October, Tesla's market value for the first time exceeded $1 trillion, making it more valuable than General Motors, Ford Motor, Toyota, Volkswagen, Stellantis, BMW and several other automakers combined.  On Friday, Tesla's stock closed at $1,056.78, up from just under $700 at the end of 2020. The stock's rise was fueled by increasing sales and profits. In the third quarter, the company earned $1.6 billion, more than double its earnings in all of 2020, its first profitable year.  With shares at dizzying heights, Mr. Musk began selling large chunks of his stock, partly to cover taxes, after taking a poll among his followers on Twitter. Several times he said he was done selling but continued.  In total, Mr. Musk sold more than $16 billion worth of Tesla stock. The transactions involved the exercising of 22.8 million options awarded to Mr. Musk as part of his compensation and bonus packages.  Tesla has said it hopes deliveries will increase about 50 percent a year for the next several years, and is counting on output from its Austin and Berlin factories to reach its goal. Both factories are expected to begin producing Model Y hatchbacks soon.  At the same time, Tesla's product quality has remained uneven. On Thursday, the company told federal regulators that it planned to recall more than 475,000 cars for two separate defects that could affect safety -- a misaligned latch on the front hood, which could allow the hood to open unexpectedly, and wiring to the rearview camera that can be damaged by opening and closing the trunk. A day later, vehicles in China were recalled as well.  In addition, the company and its Autopilot driver-assistance system have come under closer scrutiny by safety regulators in the United States. Teslas have been involved in a series of crashes with other vehicles, including some that resulted in fatalities, while the Autopilot system was engaged.  The company continues to promote its Autopilot system, which can take over some of the steering, braking and accelerating tasks from drivers, and a more advanced set of features, Full Self Driving, that it offers for $10,000 but has so far allowed only a select group of customers to test.  In August, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened a formal investigation into how Autopilot recognizes objects on the road. It is specifically looking into 11 instances when Teslas crashed into emergency vehicles that had stopped on highways and had their lights flashing.  The agency is also looking at more than two dozen other crashes involving Teslas that were under Autopilot control. Eight of those crashes have resulted in a total of 10 deaths since the first occurred in 2016.

"Document NYTF000020211209ehc900037","Business/Financial Desk; SECTB","Video Games In Tesla Cars Are Raising Safety Fears","By Neal E. Boudette","1198 words","9 December 2021","The New York Times","NYTF","Late Edition - Final","1",NA,"English","Copyright 2021 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.","Not long after buying a Tesla Model 3 this summer, Vince Patton saw a YouTube clip highlighting a feature that took him by surprise: three video games that can be played on the large touch screen mounted in front of the dashboard -- while driving down the road.  ''I thought surely that can't be right,'' Mr. Patton, a retiree in Lake Oswego, Ore.","But in a parking lot, he gave it a try, and he was able to play a solitaire game on the Model 3 while in motion. ''I only did it for like five seconds and then turned it off,'' he said. ''I'm astonished. To me, it just seems inherently dangerous.''  The automaker added the games in an over-the-air software update that was sent to most of its cars this summer. They can be played by a driver or by a passenger in full view of the driver, raising fresh questions about whether Tesla is compromising safety as it rushes to add new technologies and features in its cars.  ''It's a big concern if it plays in view of the driver, for sure,'' said Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association, which coordinates state efforts to promote safe driving.  Tesla's Autopilot system, which can steer, slow and accelerate a car on its own, has for several years faced criticism from safety experts because it allows drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel for extended periods, even though they are not supposed to. And it lacks an effective means of ensuring that drivers keep their eyes on the road.  The combination of hands-free driving and drivers' looking away from the road has been connected to at least 12 traffic deaths since 2016 in Tesla cars that were operating in Autopilot mode, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Mr. Adkins said the addition of video games ''is crying out for NHTSA to provide some guidance and regulation.''  After this article was published online, the safety agency said on Wednesday that it was looking into the video game feature and was discussing it with Tesla.  Tesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, did not respond to several emails asking about the new video games and whether they could jeopardize safety.  Distracted driving is a major cause of the rising number of traffic deaths in the United States. In the first six months of this year, 20,160 people died in traffic crashes, according to estimates from the Department of Transportation. That was up 18.4 percent from the first half of 2020, and the highest total since 2006.  Driver inattention is officially cited as the cause of about 10 percent of traffic deaths, said Steve Kiefer, a senior General Motors executive who also heads a foundation dedicated to combating distracted driving. But he and other safety experts believe the actual figure is much higher because, they say, crash investigations often overlook distraction while naming other causes, such as reckless driving.  ''I think the number's closer to 50 percent,'' Mr. Kiefer said.  The Kiefer Foundation is dedicated to his son, Mitchel, who was killed at age 18 in 2016 when a distracted driver rear-ended his car on a highway in Michigan.  Distracted driving stems from activities that take drivers' hands from the steering wheel, draw their eyes away from the road or divert their attention from the driving task. It is often linked to smartphone use, such as texting or emailing while at the wheel, but drivers sometimes read books or put on makeup. Some states outlaw the hand-held use of cellphones while driving. Automakers, Apple and Google have developed in-car software to make it easier to use voice commands to send text messages and place phone calls, keeping hands free, while on the go.  Automakers have also added mechanisms to reduce potential distraction from front-seat screens. Stellantis -- formerly Fiat Chrysler -- offers an entertainment system that can play DVDs on a front screen, but it goes dark if the car is shifted out of park. Many navigation systems do not allow addresses to be entered manually while a car is in motion. Mazda vehicles prohibit most use of the dashboard screen while in motion.  G.M.'s Super Cruise system, which can steer and brake and allows drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel, has an infrared camera to track the driver's eyes. If they stray from the road, Super Cruise issues a warning, or shuts off and hands control back to the driver.  ''We feel that with driver monitoring and eye monitoring, these features can be enacted quite safely,'' said Mr. Kiefer, who heads G.M.'s international operations.  Some Tesla cars have simpler cameras that look at a driver's face, but the cameras detect less in the dark and do not precisely track eye gaze. Four years ago, after investigating a fatal Autopilot crash, the National Transportation Safety Board recommended that Tesla add an infrared camera to improve driver monitoring, but the company has not done so.  ''It's incredibly frustrating,'' said Jennifer Homendy, the safety board's chair. ''We're trying to warn the public and tell Tesla, 'Hey, you need to put some safeguards in.' But they haven't.''  The safety board investigates transportation accidents and can recommend measures to improve safety but has no power to force companies to take action. NHTSA serves that role.  NHTSA has issued guidelines telling automakers that any in-vehicle entertainment devices should be designed so the driver cannot use them ''to perform inherently distracting secondary tasks while driving.''  Until this summer, video games in Tesla's software package -- there were more than a dozen -- could be played only while a car was in park. That changed when the 2021.12.25.6 update was beamed to Tesla vehicles. It added solitaire; a jet fighter game, Sky Force Reloaded; and The Battle of Polytopia: Moonrise, a conquest strategy game. Mr. Patton said that he was able to get access to all three with his car in drive, and that he had filed a complaint with NHTSA through its website.  In a warning that appears before the game starts, Tesla signals its awareness that solitaire can be played while the car is moving: ''Solitaire is a game for everyone, but playing while the car is in motion is only for passengers.'' A button asks for confirmation that the player is a passenger, but a driver can play simply by touching it.  In a second YouTube video, another Tesla owner also shows how the game can be played while the car is in drive. ''This is pretty dangerous,'' the owner says in the video. ''I'm sure somebody's going to use Autopilot and then play solitaire while they're on Autopilot. Take note of that, Tesla.''

"Document NYTF000020211207ehc70004r","National Desk; SECTA","Pushing for Self-Driving Tesla, Musk Downplayed Tech Limits","By Cade Metz and Neal E. Boudette","2838 words","7 December 2021","The New York Times","NYTF","Late Edition - Final","1",NA,"English","Copyright 2021 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.","To hear more audio stories from publications like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android .  Elon Musk built his electric car company, Tesla, around the promise that it represented the future of driving -- a phrase emblazoned on the automaker's website.","Much of that promise was centered on Autopilot, a system of features that could steer, brake and accelerate the company's sleek electric vehicles on highways. Over and over, Mr. Musk declared that truly autonomous driving was nearly at hand -- the day when a Tesla could drive itself -- and that the capability would be whisked to drivers over the air in software updates.  Unlike technologists at almost every other company working on self-driving vehicles, Mr. Musk insisted that autonomy could be achieved solely with cameras tracking their surroundings. But many Tesla engineers questioned whether it was safe enough to rely on cameras without the benefit of other sensing devices -- and whether Mr. Musk was promising drivers too much about Autopilot's capabilities.  Now those questions are at the heart of an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration after at least 12 accidents in which Teslas using Autopilot drove into parked fire trucks, police cars and other emergency vehicles, killing one person and injuring 17 others.  Families are suing Tesla over fatal crashes, and Tesla customers are suing the company for misrepresenting Autopilot and a set of sister services called Full Self Driving, or F.S.D.  As the guiding force behind Autopilot, Mr. Musk pushed it in directions other automakers were unwilling to take this kind of technology, interviews with 19 people who worked on the project over the last decade show. Mr. Musk repeatedly misled buyers about the services' abilities, many of those people say. All spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation from Mr. Musk and Tesla.  Mr. Musk and a top Tesla lawyer did not respond to multiple email requests for comment for this article over several weeks, including a detailed list of questions. But the company has consistently said that the onus is on drivers to stay alert and take control of their cars should Autopilot malfunction.  Since the start of Tesla's work on Autopilot, there has been a tension between safety and Mr. Musk's desire to market Tesla cars as technological marvels.  For years, Mr. Musk has said Tesla cars were on the verge of complete autonomy. ''The basic news is that all Tesla vehicles leaving the factory have all the hardware necessary for Level 5 autonomy,'' he declared in 2016. The statement surprised and concerned some working on the project, since the Society of Automotive Engineers defines Level 5 as full driving automation.  More recently, he has said that new software -- currently part of a beta test by a limited number of Tesla owners who have bought the F.S.D. package -- will allow cars to drive themselves on city streets as well as highways. But as with Autopilot, Tesla documentation says drivers must keep their hands on the wheel, ready to take control of the car at any time.  Regulators have warned that Tesla and Mr. Musk have exaggerated the sophistication of Autopilot, encouraging some people to misuse it.  ''Where I get concerned is the language that's used to describe the capabilities of the vehicle,'' said Jennifer Homendy, chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, which has investigated accidents involving Autopilot and criticized the system's design. ''It can be very dangerous.''  In addition, some who have long worked on autonomous vehicles for other companies -- as well as seven former members of the Autopilot team -- have questioned Tesla's practice of constant modifications to Autopilot and F.S.D., pushed out to drivers through software updates, saying it can be hazardous because buyers are never quite sure what the system can and cannot do.  Hardware choices have also raised safety questions. Within Tesla, some argued for pairing cameras with radar and other sensors that worked better in heavy rain and snow, bright sunshine and other difficult conditions. For several years, Autopilot incorporated radar, and for a time Tesla worked on developing its own radar technology. But three people who worked on the project said Mr. Musk had repeatedly told members of the Autopilot team that humans could drive with only two eyes and that this meant cars should be able to drive with cameras alone.  They said he saw this as ''returning to first principles'' -- a term Mr. Musk and others in the technology industry have long used to refer to sweeping aside standard practices and rethinking problems from scratch. In May of this year, Mr. Musk said on Twitter that Tesla was no longer putting radar on new cars. He said the company had tested the safety implications of not using radar but provided no details.  Some people have applauded Mr. Musk, saying that a certain amount of compromise and risk was justified as he strove to reach mass production and ultimately change the automobile industry.  But recently, even Mr. Musk has expressed some doubts about Tesla's technology. After repeatedly describing Full Self Driving in speeches, in interviews and on social media as a system on the verge of full autonomy, Mr. Musk in August called it ''not great.'' The team working on it, he said on Twitter, ''is rallying to improve as fast as possible.''  Cameras as Eyes  Tesla began developing Autopilot more than seven years ago as an effort to meet new safety standards in Europe, which required technology like automatic braking, according to three people familiar with the origins of the project.  The company originally called this an ''advanced driver assistance'' project, but was soon exploring a new name. Executives led by Mr. Musk decided on ''Autopilot,'' though some Tesla engineers objected to the name as misleading, favoring ''Copilot'' and other options, these three people said.  The name was borrowed from the aviation systems that allow planes to fly themselves in ideal conditions with limited pilot input.  At Autopilot's official announcement in October 2014, Tesla said that the system would brake automatically and keep the car in a lane but added that ''the driver is still responsible for, and ultimately in control of, the car.'' It said that self-driving cars were ''still years away from becoming a reality.''  At the beginning, Autopilot used cameras, radar and sound-wave sensors. But Mr. Musk told engineers that the system should eventually be able to drive autonomously from door to door -- and it should do so solely with cameras, according to three people who worked on the project.  They said the Autopilot team continued to develop the system using radar and even planned to expand the number of radar sensors on each car, as well as exploring lidar -- ''light detection and ranging'' devices that measure distances using laser pulses.  But Mr. Musk insisted that his two-eyes metaphor was the way forward and questioned whether radar was ultimately worth the headache and expense of buying and integrating radar technology from third parties, four people who worked on the Autopilot team said.  Over time, the company and the team moved closer to his way of thinking, placing more emphasis on camera technology, these people said.  Other companies developing driver-assistance systems and fully autonomous cars thought cameras were not enough. Google, for example, outfitted its self-driving test cars with expensive lidar devices as big as buckets mounted on the roof.  Cameras, by contrast, were cheap and small, which made them appealing to Tesla for its sleek cars. Radar, which uses radio waves and has been around for decades, was cheaper than lidar, a less common technology. But according to three people who worked on the project, some engineers backed Mr. Musk's cameras-only approach, arguing that radar was not always accurate and that it was difficult to reconcile radar data with information from cameras.  Autonomous driving experts said Mr. Musk's cameras-as-eyes analogy was deeply flawed, as did eight former Autopilot engineers interviewed for this article, though some said there were colleagues who supported Mr. Musk's view.  Aesthetics also influenced decisions about radar.  In late 2014, Tesla began installing radar on its Model S sedans as it prepared to roll out the first version of Autopilot. But Mr. Musk did not like the way the radar looked inside an open hole in the front of the cars and told his engineers to install a rubber seal, according to two people who worked on the project at the time, even though some employees warned that the seal could trap snow and ice and prevent the system from working properly.  These people said the company went ahead with Mr. Musk's instructions without testing the design in winter weather -- but resolved the situation after customers complained that the radar stopped working in winter.  In mid-2015, Mr. Musk met with a group of Tesla engineering managers to discuss their plans for the second version of Autopilot. One manager, an auto industry veteran named Hal Ockerse, told Mr. Musk he wanted to include a computer chip and other hardware that could monitor the physical components of Autopilot and provide backup if parts of the system suddenly stopped working, according to two people with knowledge of the meeting.  But Mr. Musk slapped down the idea, they said, arguing it would slow the progress of the project as Tesla worked to build a system that could drive cars by themselves. Already angry after Autopilot malfunctioned on his morning drive that day, Mr. Musk berated Mr. Ockerse for even suggesting the idea. Mr. Ockerse soon left the company.  By the end of 2015, Mr. Musk was publicly saying that Teslas would drive themselves within about two years. ''I think we have all the pieces, and it's just about refining those pieces, putting them in place, and making sure they work across a huge number of environments -- and then we're done,'' he told Fortune magazine.  Other companies like Google, Toyota and Nissan exploring autonomous driving were not nearly as optimistic in their public statements.  A Fatal Accident  In May 2016, about six months after Mr. Musk's remarks appeared in Fortune, a Model S owner, Joshua Brown, was killed in Florida when Autopilot failed to recognize a tractor-trailer crossing in front of him. His car had radar and a camera.  Mr. Musk held a short meeting with the Autopilot team and briefly addressed the accident. He did not delve into the details of what went wrong but told the team that the company must work to ensure that its cars did not hit anything, according to two people who were part of the meeting.  Tesla later said that during the crash, Autopilot's camera could not distinguish between the white truck and the bright sky. Tesla has never publicly explained why the radar did not prevent the accident. Radar technology, like cameras and lidar, is not flawless. But most in the industry believe that this means you need as many types of sensors as possible.  Less than a month after the crash, Mr. Musk said at an event hosted by Recode, a tech publication, that autonomous driving was ''basically a solved problem'' and that Teslas could already drive more safely than humans. He made no mention of the accident in which Mr. Brown was killed, though Tesla said in a blog post a few weeks later -- headlined ''A Tragic Loss'' -- that it had immediately reported the episode to federal regulators.  While it is not clear that they were influenced by the fatal accident, Mr. Musk and Tesla soon showed a renewed interest in radar, according to three engineers who worked on Autopilot. The company began an effort to build its own radar technology, rather than using sensors built by other suppliers. The company hired Duc Vu, an expert in the field, in October 2016 from the auto parts company Delphi.  But 16 months later, Mr. Vu suddenly parted ways with the company after a disagreement he had with another executive over a new wiring system in Tesla's cars, the three people said. In the weeks and months that followed, other members of the radar team left as well.  Over several months after those departures, Tesla reclassified the radar effort as a research undertaking rather than one actively aimed at production, the three people said.  The Quest for Fully Autonomous Cars  As Tesla approached the introduction of Autopilot 2.0, most of the Autopilot team dropped their normal duties to work on a video meant to show just how autonomous the system could be. But the final video did not provide a full picture of how the car operated during the filming.  The route taken by the car had been charted ahead of time by software that created a three-dimensional digital map, a feature unavailable to drivers using the commercial version of Autopilot, according to two former members of the Autopilot team. At one point during the filming of the video, the car hit a roadside barrier on Tesla property while using Autopilot and had to be repaired, three people who worked on the video said.  The video was later used to promote Autopilot's capabilities, and it is still on Tesla's website.  When Mr. Musk unveiled Autopilot 2.0 in October 2016, he said at the news conference that all new Tesla cars now included the cameras, computing power and all other hardware they would need for ''full self driving'' -- not a technical term, but one that suggested truly autonomous operation.  His statements took the engineering team by surprise, and some felt that Mr. Musk was promising something that was not possible, according to two people who worked on the project.  Sterling Anderson, who led the project at the time and later started an autonomous driving company called Aurora, told Tesla's sales and marketing teams that they should not refer to the company's technology as ''autonomous'' or ''self-driving'' because this would mislead the public, according to two former employees.  Some in the company may have heeded the advice, but Tesla was soon using the term ''full self driving'' as a standard way of describing its technology.  By 2017, Tesla began selling a set of services that the company has described as a more advanced version of Autopilot, calling the package Full Self Driving. Its features include responding to traffic lights and stop signs -- and changing lanes without being prompted to by the driver. The company sold the package for up to $10,000.  Engineers who have worked on the technology acknowledge that these services have yet to reach the full autonomy implied in its name and promised by Mr. Musk in public statements. ''I'm highly confident the car will drive itself for the reliability in excess of a human this year,'' he said during an earnings call in January 2021. ''This is a very big deal.''  In early November, Tesla recalled nearly 12,000 vehicles that were part of the beta test of new F.S.D. features, after deploying a software update that the company said might cause crashes because of unexpected activation of the cars' emergency braking system.  Schuyler Cullen, who oversaw a team that explored autonomous-driving possibilities at the South Korean tech giant Samsung, said in an interview that Mr. Musk's cameras-only approach was fundamentally flawed. ''Cameras are not eyes! Pixels are not retinal ganglia! The F.S.D. computer is nothing like the visual cortex!'' said Mr. Cullen, a computer vision specialist who now runs a start-up that is building a new kind of camera-based sensor.  Amnon Shashua, chief executive of Mobileye, a former Tesla supplier that has been testing technology that is similar to the electric-car maker's, said Mr. Musk's idea of using only cameras in a self-driving system could ultimately work, though other sensors may be needed in the short term. He added that Mr. Musk might exaggerate the capabilities of the company's technology, but that those statements shouldn't be taken too seriously.  ''One should not be hung up on what Tesla says,'' Mr. Shashua said. ''Truth is not necessarily their end goal. The end goal is to build a business.''

Boudette","852 words","21 October 2021","The New York Times","NYTF","Late Edition - Final","3",NA,"English","Copyright 2021 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.","The automaker also reported a big jump in revenue, to $13.8 billion from $8.8 billion a year ago, as sales of the Model Y continue to rise.  Tesla made $1.6 billion in the three months ending in September, the second quarter in a row that its profit has exceeded the billion-dollar mark.","The bottom-line figure exceeded the $1.1 billion it made in the second quarter and was nearly five times its profit from the third quarter of 2020.  The automaker reported a big jump in revenue, to $13.8 billion from $8.8 billion a year ago, as sales of the Model Y continued to rise in the United States, China and Europe. The company delivered 241,000 cars to customers in the quarter, up from 140,000 a year ago.  Electric vehicle ''demand continues to go through a structural shift,'' the company said in a statement. ''We believe the more vehicles we have on the road, the more Tesla owners are able to spread the word about the benefits of E.V.s.''  Tesla repeated a previous forecast that sales would grow about 50 percent per year on average for the next few years, but the company cautioned that ''semiconductor shortages, congestion at ports and rolling blackouts have been impacting our ability to keep factories running at full speed.''  The company said it expected to begin production of the Model Y at new factories near Berlin and Austin, Texas, before the end of the year. ''The pace of the respective production ramps will be influenced by the successful introduction of many new product and manufacturing technologies in new locations, ongoing supply chain-related challenges and regional permitting,'' Tesla said.  In an important shift, the company said it would start using lithium iron phosphate batteries for all but its long-range cars. Those types of batteries, which are popular in China, tend to be cheaper because they do not use cobalt, an expensive mineral that is primarily mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Lithium iron phosphate batteries can store less energy than the lithium ion batteries that Tesla had been using in most of its cars.  A portion of Tesla's profit comes from selling regulatory credits to automakers that need them to meet emission standards. Tesla reported $279 million in sales of such credits in the third quarter, compared with $397 million in the third quarter of 2020.  The strong earnings report indicates consumers are still flocking to Tesla even as the company faces questions about the safety of its Autopilot driver-assist system and as established automakers roll out electric cars and trucks.  Autopilot, a computerized system that uses cameras and other sensors to steer, brake and accelerate cars on its own, is the subject of an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the top federal auto-safety regulator. The agency is looking into whether Autopilot fails to see parked police cars and other emergency vehicles with flashing lights. The agency has identified 12 accidents in which Teslas operating in Autopilot mode crashed into emergency vehicles.  Tesla recently sent a software update to Autopilot-equipped cars that was supposed to improve detection of emergency vehicles. The traffic safety agency asked Tesla to provide extensive data about the fix and to explain why it did not initiate a safety recall before distributing the update.  The traffic safety agency had come under criticism for a lax approach to regulating new technologies like Autopilot and self-driving cars. On Tuesday, the Biden administration appointed Mary Cummings, a Duke University expert in self-driving technology, to a senior auto-safety post at the federal agency, signaling that Tesla may now face tougher scrutiny.  Ms. Cummings has criticized Autopilot, noting the system does not effectively monitor drivers to make sure they are paying attention to the road. In a message posted on Twitter, Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, said on Tuesday that Ms. Cummings was ''extremely biased'' against Tesla.  Tesla does not appear to have lost many customers to competitors. Ford Motor began selling its Mustang Mach-E, an electric sport-utility vehicle, but its sales have been modest by the standards of the Model Y because the global shortage of computer chips has disrupted production for most auto manufacturers. Rivian, a start-up considered a potential rival to Tesla, has started producing an electric pickup truck, but so far it has only delivered a small number to customers; the company won't say how many.  Porsche, the German automaker owned by the Volkswagen Group, has made inroads against Tesla with its Taycan electric sports car. In the first three quarters of this year, Porsche has sold more than 28,000 Taycans, which starts at about $82,000, about as much as a Tesla Model S or Model X costs. By comparison, Tesla sold 13,000 S and X vehicles.   ART 	 A Model 3 on a lot in Colorado. (PHOTOGRAPH BY DAVID ZALUBOWSKI/ASSOCIATED PRESS)  CO 	 teslmi : Tesla, Inc.

Boudette","509 words","2 September 2021","The New York Times","NYTF","Late Edition - Final","3",NA,"English","Copyright 2021 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.","The request by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is part of an investigation into Tesla cars crashing into parked emergency vehicles.  The main federal auto safety agency has ordered Tesla to hand over a trove of data on its Autopilot driver-assistance system as part of an investigation into Tesla cars crashing into fire trucks or other emergency vehicles parked on roads and highways.","In a letter dated Tuesday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration told the electric carmaker to produce detailed information on how Autopilot works, how it ensures drivers are paying attention to the road and whether there are any limits on where it can be turned on.  The safety agency is also seeking detailed data on how many cars Tesla has sold in the United States, any arbitration proceedings or lawsuits related to Autopilot crashes that the company has been involved in, and the complaints Tesla has received about Autopilot from customers.  The agency asked Tesla to deliver the information by Oct. 22, noting that it could impose fines of up to $115 million if the company fails or refuses to comply. The letter is signed by Gregory Magno, chief of the vehicle defects division in the agency's Office of Defects Investigation.  The safety agency informed Tesla weeks ago that it was looking into the spate of crashes in which Tesla vehicles operating on Autopilot failed to detect stopped emergency vehicles with flashing lights. The regulator originally said it was looking into 11 such crashes. A 12th occurred on Saturday, when a Model 3 hit a police cruiser that had stopped behind a car that had broken down on an interstate in Orlando, Fla.  The driver told the police that the Model 3 had been in Autopilot mode, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. The Tesla narrowly missed hitting a state trooper.  The request for data suggests that the safety agency's investigation is moving quickly. Safety experts have criticized the agency for doing little to investigate a growing number of crashes, injuries and fatalities involving Tesla vehicles operating with Autopilot turned on over the last five years. The safety agency said this summer that it was looking into about 30 Autopilot-related crashes, including eight that resulted in 10 deaths.  Safety experts and another federal agency, the National Transportation Safety Board, have pointed out that Autopilot lacks effective safeguards to ensure drivers keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel while using the system. It is supposed to be used only on divided highways but lacks mechanisms for prohibiting use on local roads -- features that General Motors, Ford Motor and other automakers have built into similar systems.

All Rights Reserved.","As federal investigators escalate their scrutiny of Tesla's driver-assistance technology, another problem is emerging for the electric carmaker: complaints among customers that they have been sold an additional driver-assistance option that doesn't operate as advertised.  Over the years, Tesla owners have paid as much as $10,000 for the package, called Full Self-Driving. F.S.D., which can be purchased as an extra on Tesla cars, is a collection of services that add to Tesla's Autopilot, the driver-assistance technology that government investigators are taking a look at after a string of crashes.","Critics say F.S.D. hasn't lived up to its name since its debut more than two years ago. It can help a car navigate off one highway and onto another, and respond to traffic lights and stop signs. It also includes a service for summoning a car out of a parking space or parking lot with a mobile app. But full self-driving? Not quite.  When Joel M. Young paid $6,000 for F.S.D. in 2019, he assumed he would receive a system that could drive anywhere on its own by year's end. Two years later, that remains beyond the system's abilities. Mr. Young, a lawyer, writer and car enthusiast living in Placitas, N.M., recently asked Tesla to refund his money, and it declined. On Wednesday, he sued the company, accusing it of fraud and breach of contract, among other complaints.  ''Tesla has not delivered what it promised,'' he said.  Mr. Young's suit is most likely the second from a customer aimed at the F.S.D. add-on feature. Two brothers in Southern California have filed a suit that raises similar complaints. And as many enthusiasts on social media platforms like Reddit question whether they have paid for something that does not exist, the California Department of Motor Vehicles recently said it was reviewing Tesla's use of the term Full Self-Driving.  Also on Wednesday, Senators Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, both Democrats, sent the chair of the Federal Trade Commission a letter calling on the agency to investigate the marketing and advertising of Autopilot and F.S.D.  Tesla privately acknowledges the limitations of the technology. As the public advocacy website PlainSite recently revealed after a public records request, Tesla officials have told California regulators that the company is unlikely to offer technology that can drive in any situation on its own by the end of 2021.  ''If we can't trust Tesla when they say their vehicles are full self-driving, how can we trust the company when it says they are safe?'' said Bryant Walker Smith, an associate professor in the Schools of Law and Engineering at the University of South Carolina who specializes in autonomous vehicles.  Tesla did not respond to several requests for comment.  Complaints about the F.S.D. kit may pale in comparison with the concerns that people are being killed by misuse of or glitches in Tesla's driver-assistance technology. But they point to a common thread of Tesla's approach to driving automation: The company is making promises that other carmakers shrink from, and its customers think their cars can do more on their own than they really can.  ''One of the downsides of automated technology can be overreliance -- people relying on something it may not be able to do,'' said Jason K. Levine, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a nonprofit that has monitored the industry since the early 1970s.  Other automakers are being considerably more conservative when it comes to automation. The likes of General Motors and Toyota offer driver-assistance technologies akin to Autopilot and F.S.D., but they do not market them as self-driving systems.  Backed by billions of dollars from major automakers and tech giants, companies like Argo, Cruise and Waymo have been developing and testing autonomous vehicles for years. But in the near term, they have no intention of selling the technology to consumers. They are designing vehicles they hope to deploy in certain cities as ride-hailing services. Think Uber without the drivers.  In each city, they begin by building a detailed, three-dimensional map. First they equip ordinary cars with lidar sensors -- ''light detection and ranging'' devices that measure distances using pulses of light. As company workers drive these cars around the city, the sensors collect all the information needed to generate the map, pinpointing the distance to every curb, median and roadside tree.  The cars then use this map to navigate roads on their own. They continue to monitor their surroundings using lidar, and they compare what they see with what the map shows, keeping close track of where they are in the world.  At the same time, these sensors alert the cars to nearby objects, including other cars, pedestrians and bicyclists. But they do not do this alone. Additional sensors -- including radar and cameras -- do much the same. Each sensor provides its own snapshot of what is happening on the road, serving as a check on the others.  Waymo now offers an automated ride-hailing service in the suburbs of Phoenix, but the roads are wide, pedestrians are few and rain is rare. Expanding into other areas is a painstaking process that involves constant testing and retesting, mapping and remapping. Chris Urmson, the chief executive of the autonomous vehicle company Aurora, said the rollout could take 30 years or more.  Tesla is taking a very different tack. The company and its chief executive, Elon Musk, believe that self-driving cars can navigate city streets without three-dimensional maps. After all, human drivers do not need these maps. They need only eyes.  For years, Tesla has argued that autonomous vehicles can understand their surroundings merely by capturing what a human driver would see as they speed down the road. That means the cars need only one kind of sensor: cameras.  Since its cars are already equipped with cameras, Tesla argues, it can transform them into autonomous vehicles by gradually improving the software that analyzes and responds to what the cameras see. F.S.D. is a step toward that.  But F.S.D. has notable limits, said Jake Fisher, senior director of Consumer Reports' Auto Test Center, who has extensively tested these services. Automatically changing lanes can be enormously stressful and potentially dangerous, for instance, and summoning the car from a parking space works only occasionally.  ''These systems are good at dealing with the boring, monotonous stuff,'' Mr. Fisher said. ''But when things get interesting, I prefer to drive.''  Machines cannot yet reason like a human. Cars can capture what is happening around them, but they struggle to completely understand what they have captured and predict what will happen next.  That's why other companies are deploying their autonomous cars so slowly. And it is why they equip these cars with additional sensors, including lidar and radar. Radar and lidar can track the speed of nearby objects as well as their distance, giving cars a better sense of what is happening.  Tesla recently removed the radar from its new cars, which now rely solely on cameras, as the company always said they would. During a January earnings call, Mr. Musk said he was ''highly confident the car will be able to drive itself with reliability in excess of humans this year.''  This promise rests on a ''beta'' service, now under test with a limited number of Tesla owners, that aims to automate driving beyond highways. In a March post on Twitter, Mr. Musk estimated that 2,000 people were using the beta, called ''Autosteer on city streets.''  But like Autopilot and other F.S.D. services, the beta calls for drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and take control of the car when needed.  Most experts say this is unlikely to change soon. Given the speed of cameras and the limitations in the algorithms that analyze camera images, there are still situations where such a setup cannot react quickly enough to avoid crashes, said Schuyler Cullen, a computer vision specialist who oversaw autonomous driving efforts at the South Korean tech giant Samsung.  With a system that relies solely on cameras, crash rates will be too high to offer the technology on a wide scale without driver oversight, said Amnon Shashua, chief executive of Mobileye, a company that supplies driver-assistance technology to most major carmakers and has been testing technology that is similar to what Tesla is testing. Today, he said, additional sensors are needed.  Tesla was not necessarily wrong to remove the radar from its cars, Mr. Shashua added. There are questions about the usefulness of radar sensors, and Tesla may have seen an opportunity to remove their cost. But that does not mean the company can reach full autonomy solely with cameras. The technology needed to do this safely and reliably does not yet exist.  ''That approach, in my opinion, will never work,'' Dr. Cullen said.

Walmart on Tuesday reported $566 billion in sales over a similar period. A pandemic-driven surge in online shopping accelerated the timeline for what many saw as an inevitable milestone. Even so, online sales still represent just 14 percent of overall retail spending.  Facebook Trust Issues  The Federal Trade Commission refiled its antitrust lawsuit against Facebook on Thursday. The new complaint is more detailed and almost twice as long as the original, but the claim is the same: Facebook holds a monopoly on social networking that it has tried to maintain through acquisitions. In the past, monopoly power has often been gauged by impact on prices. A federal judge threw out the F.T.C.'s initial Facebook case in June, highlighting the challenge of defining a monopoly when the product is free.  What's Next? (Aug. 22-28)  Taper Talk  Central bankers meet for their annual gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyo., starting on Thursday. The Federal Reserve has made important announcements at the event in the past, and many expect Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, to reveal details about how and when the bank plans to begin winding down its bond-buying program, one of several policies it created to reduce the economic impact of the pandemic. Minutes from the Fed's last meeting showed that officials generally agreed that they would soon meet their standards for slowing bond-buying, but they were still debating exactly when to begin the so-called taper.  U.K. Travel Restrictions  The U.K. will make updates to its much-criticized ''traffic light'' system of pandemic travel restrictions. Under the system, residents traveling to ''green list'' countries do not need to quarantine upon return but are required to take coronavirus tests. Those returning from countries on the ''amber list,'' which includes the United States, must be tested and, unless they are fully immunized with an approved vaccine, isolate for 10 days. People returning from ''red list'' countries may only enter Britain if they have residence rights, and then must quarantine for 10 days in a government-approved hotel.  Paralympics Begin  Tokyo is still grappling with a high level of coronavirus infections and a low rate of vaccination while preparing for the Paralympics to start on Tuesday. As with the Olympics, no spectators will be allowed at the games.  What Else?  Retail sales fell in July, but the Delta variant is not to blame. Facebook is betting you'll want to attend meetings in virtual reality. ''Jeopardy!'' is looking for a permanent host once again. And Pope Francis called getting vaccinated ''an act of love.''

"Document NYTF000020210822eh8m0006o","Money and Business/Financial Desk; SECTBU","God, Money, YOLO: How Cathie Wood Found a Flock","By Matt Phillips","3370 words","22 August 2021","The New York Times","NYTF","Late Edition - Final","1",NA,"English","Copyright 2021 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.","Ms. Wood says the Holy Spirit moved her to strike out on her own after an up-and-down career in money management. But it's her belief in herself that won the Reddit crowd's faith.  Cathie Wood was in familiar territory. She was listening to someone tell her she was wrong.","It was February 2018. Ms. Wood, a veteran money manager and the chief executive of Ark Invest, was on a panel on CNBC with the Canadian entrepreneur Kevin O'Leary, who is best known as Mr. Wonderful on the business-related reality show ''Shark Tank.''  The topic was Tesla, and the two did not agree. At the time, Tesla shares were trading just below record-high levels, even though the company was facing one of the roughest patches in its history. Its stock was indefensibly expensive compared with those of other automakers, Mr. O'Leary argued. As giants like General Motors entered the electric vehicle business, the premium that Tesla's shares commanded from investors was bound to shrink.  ''No,'' said Ms. Wood, the only female investor on the panel that day, after hearing Mr. O'Leary out. She then rattled off all the reasons Elon Musk's company was different. G.M. doesn't have the software engineers, distribution network or battery technology that Tesla has. In the future, software, artificial intelligence and automaking would converge. Tesla was ready for that.  ''The future is electric. G.M.'s not electric yet,'' she said.  It was classic Cathie Wood, a mash-up of in-the-weeds business analysis and an almost prophetic certainty about the future. It was also precisely what the online army of fanatical Tesla shareholders wanted to hear.  As Tesla struggled with production problems, dwindling cash and an erratic Mr. Musk in 2018, Ms. Wood gave a full-throated defense of the company, her largest single holding. That began an unlikely mind meld between Ms. Wood and the new generation of tech-focused, risk-hungry people who started trading in droves in 2020.  On paper, she seems an odd standard-bearer for these younger, diverse and deeply irreverent ranks of retail investors. Ms. Wood is a 65-year-old creature of Wall Street's asset management industry and the well-heeled Connecticut suburbs, as well as a deeply religious donor to conservative political campaigns.  But Ms. Wood and her firm's unusual approach to investing -- which combines high levels of risk with high levels of transparency about her views to produce, at least last year, astronomically high returns -- have connected with new investors in a way the financial industry had only dreamed of.  Her aggressive bets on often unprofitable technology stocks are a better fit for traders who brag on Reddit about YOLO-ing their rent money than it ever was for the endowments and institutions that rely on the traditional money management industry, where she spent more than 30 years.  In other words, Ms. Wood has finally found her people.  ''I listened to her and I was like, 'That's how I think,''' said Casey Flores, a 30-year-old amateur trader from Richmond, Va., who first saw Ms. Wood on CNBC over a year ago and was soon following her every trade. ''I just was like, 'I like this lady.'''  Her ability to connect with individual investors like Mr. Flores has helped make Ms. Wood the most influential investor at work in the markets today. After the funds she managed posted astounding gains in 2020, many of these new traders have embraced her feast-or-famine style of investing the way previous generations mimicked the relatively risk-averse methods of stock pickers like Fidelity's Peter Lynch or Berkshire Hathaway's Warren E. Buffett.  Ms. Wood is unlikely to match last year's performance, which was driven by an unpredictable confluence of events: the economic shock of the Covid-19 pandemic; the Federal Reserve's move to cut interest rates; the trading boom among individual investors. Her funds are trailing the overall market badly in 2021.  Even so, Ms. Wood has already changed Wall Street, perhaps for good, as some of the world's biggest financial players rush to introduce the kind of products that she and Ark pioneered.  Ms. Wood now manages nearly $85 billion -- up from less than $10 billion at the end of 2019.  Her firm bet heavily on tech stocks that flourished with most of the country stuck at home. Its flagship fund, Ark Innovation -- crammed with shares like Roku, Zillow and the payment technology firm Square -- soared almost 150 percent, trouncing the S&P 500's 16 percent gain.  Her decisions to buy and sell companies are disclosed daily to any investor who signs up for her email updates. Her frequent -- and seemingly fearless -- pronouncements on television can make headlines and move share prices.  Despite her frequent pronouncements about transparency as a core value of her firm, Ms. Wood declined repeated requests to be interviewed for this article, which is based on conversations with former colleagues and employees and her frequent public statements to the business media and religious groups.  In such appearances, she repeatedly describes her late-career decision to start her own investment shop as more than a business leap of faith.  It began, she says, with a head-on encounter with the Holy Spirit.  A Business Plan, From Beyond  On a gorgeous day in August 2012, Ms. Wood -- a fund manager struggling through a rough quarter at AllianceBernstein -- was struck by the silence inside her stately home in Wilton, Conn.  Her three children were gone, off to camp and other activities for the summer. She was facing two full weeks alone in the nearly 6,000-square-foot house she bought with her ex-husband in the 1990s.  Then she felt it.  ''Wham,'' Ms. Wood said last year on the ''Jesus Calling'' podcast, which is centered on the devotional writings of the best-selling Christian author Sarah Young. ''I really feel like that was the Holy Spirit just saying to me, 'OK, this is the plan.'''  The plan was for Ms. Wood to use her experience as a tech investor to build a new kind of money management firm -- optimized for the social media age and embracing a level of transparency that was radical, at least on Wall Street.  To do it, Ms. Wood had to quit her job and put her personal wealth on the line at the age of 57.  ''Most of my friends told me I was nuts, and yet I wasn't listening to them. I knew that I needed to follow God's will for me,'' she told a Christian ministry organization in 2016. ''That was the only way I was going to be happy.''  The first of four children of Irish immigrants, Ms. Wood spent much of her childhood on the move -- her father was a radar technician for the Air Force -- before the family settled in Culver City, Calif. She graduated from an all-girls Catholic school in 1974, and then attended the University of Southern California, majoring in business administration.  There she found a mentor in Arthur Laffer, one of the patron saints of supply-side economics, after she petitioned to be admitted to one of his graduate courses.  ''That took a lot of chutzpah,'' Mr. Laffer, 81, said.  He found Ms. Wood to be an impressive student, unwilling, he said, to abandon any topic until she understood it completely.  ''I've never seen anyone so thorough, so careful and so research-oriented in my life, which makes her quite self-confident,'' he said.  Ms. Wood's work ethic and voracious consumption of information are recurring themes among former co-workers. She often woke well before dawn to get one of the first trains to Grand Central Terminal each day, treating the nearly two-hour journey from Connecticut as a sort of perpetual cram session on rails.  In the days before smartphones, tablets and laptop computers, colleagues remembered her lugging bags laden with research reports into and out of the office each day.  Sig Segalas co-founded Jennison Associates, a New York money management shop where Ms. Wood worked from the early 1980s until 1998, first as an economist and then as an analyst and a fund manager. For many of those years, his office was next to hers, and he remembers her as typically one of the last people to leave the office each day.  But even given her work ethic and deep preparation, Mr. Segalas -- who started on Wall Street in the early 1960s -- said Ms. Wood's tendency to present her investment decisions as near certainties was unusual.  ''I've never met anybody with as much conviction,'' he said. ''It's almost mystical, to be very honest with you.''  Of course, even the best-informed forecaster sometimes gets it wrong.  For instance, in the early 1980s, when Ms. Wood was a portfolio manager at Jennison, it held a large position in Mexican stocks. Rumors began to circulate that Mexico might devalue the peso -- a move that would crush the firm's investments there.  While many economists thought the move was unlikely, Ms. Wood was especially sure it wouldn't happen, Mr. Segalas said.  ''She was adamant. 'There's no way they're going to do it. No way they're going to do it,''' he said. ''Sure enough, they did it. And everything collapsed.''  Such an approach to investing produces sharp ups and downs, which is why volatility has been a hallmark of Ms. Wood's career and, at times, a hurdle.  In 2001, Ms. Wood joined AllianceBernstein, where she oversaw a respectable $5 billion in assets at her peak. True to form, her performance at the Manhattan firm was a roller-coaster ride. Consider the AllianceBernstein Global Thematic Growth Fund, which she took over in the midst of a brutal year, 2008, when it tumbled 45 percent. The next year it rose 55 percent.  But an analysis of her record by Morningstar, published in March, found that her investments at AllianceBernstein were notable for their high volatility and ''underwhelming long-term results.'' Her global fund fared especially poorly in 2011, tumbling roughly 24 percent when the market was flat. In 2012 -- the year of her epiphany that she should start her own firm -- she again undershot her bench mark's rise, even without subtracting the cost of fees.  Such a return profile proved a difficult fit at AllianceBernstein, which catered to conservative fiduciary institutions such as pension funds and endowments. Many simply couldn't stomach Ms. Wood's style.  ''I think she was viewed as brilliant,'' said Lisa Shalett, a colleague at AllianceBernstein who is now chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. But she was also seen as ''not institutional,'' Ms. Shalett said.  In 2013, Ms. Wood left AllianceBernstein. By January 2014, she had founded Ark.  Launching Ark  Chris Burniske, then a senior at Stanford, didn't know much about whom he was meeting that day in 2013, but he had heard that she was some sort of financial big shot.  A mutual friend had asked if he would be willing to show Cathie Wood and her son, Robert, the campus.  A surfer from Hawaii who studied ocean science, Mr. Burniske rolled up barefoot on his skateboard, and spent much of a weekend squiring Ms. Wood and her son around, using the opportunity to make a number of casual digs at the financial industry. Ms. Wood wanted to hire him anyway.  He didn't take her up on the offer at first. The idea of moving to New York and spending his days at a computer were unappealing. But after spending a few months working as a fishmonger at a Whole Foods in Austin, Texas, he decided he might give it a try.  Philosophically, Ark is unlike any other money management firm, not just in its investment strategy and products but also, and especially, in its staffing.  Mr. Burniske ultimately helped steer Ark into cryptoassets. (He has since written a book on valuing cryptoassets, and is a partner in a venture capital firm.) Another analyst, who covered automation at the company soon after it started, had little experience, though he had published a book in 2012 about how to strike it rich by trying to find silver coins mistakenly included in coin rolls. The analyst covering a broad swath of highly sophisticated technologies lists his employment history as two brief internships -- one as a brand manager for the energy drink Red Bull and a year captaining a 43-foot sailboat.  The unconventional approach extends to Ark's investment product of choice: actively managed exchange-traded funds, which allow investors to buy and sell shares throughout the trading day, just as they do with stocks. The vast majority of E.T.F.s are modeled on broadly traded indexes, which saves money because they don't need to pay professionals to pick stocks. But Ms. Wood buys and sells stocks constantly.  And anyone can follow along.  Ark churns out an unceasing stream of podcasts, white papers, YouTube videos and newsletters, broadcasting to millions of followers both Ms. Wood's image and her firm's views on investments as varied as Bitcoin and biopharmaceuticals. And decisions to buy or sell stocks are disclosed in a daily email blast that has become required reading for many traders.  Such transparency is anathema on Wall Street, where firms typically disclose their holdings once a quarter and shield their strategy from counterparts and rivals.  ''Cathie is a big believer in her stocks, and she promotes her stocks,'' Ms. Shalett said. ''So for her, it's kind of like, 'I don't mind having an open kimono.'''  Open access also seems to be a key reason that Ms. Wood has connected with the kind of investors who have recently been drawn to stock trading.  ''That's very punk rock,'' said Maximillian Lawrence, who began buying the Ark Innovation fund early last year. A 46-year-old artist and teacher in Philadelphia, Mr. Lawrence respected Ms. Wood's transparency, which fit well with the do-it-yourself ethos of the art and skateboarding communities he runs in.  ''The difference between her and a lot of these other folks is she legitimately believes in these things, and she doubles down,'' Mr. Lawrence said, injecting an expletive for emphasis. ''You can see it in her trades.''  And investors don't have to hand Ms. Wood their money to invest with her. Many, like Mr. Flores would do on occasion, just pick up shares of whatever she's buying.  Mr. Flores, who works in sales at a financial technology start-up, didn't know anything about some of the companies he was buying when he started mirroring her trades last year. But that didn't matter.  ''They would go up 11 percent, sometimes like 17 percent the next day,'' Mr. Flores said. ''It was ... wow.''  The effect was magnified as more amateurs followed along. ''It was just insane to see her buy list, and then every single thing on the buy list the next day would be up a ridiculous amount,'' he said.  Ms. Wood's disclosures continued to move the markets. Her purchase of more than 1.5 million shares of the stock-trading app Robinhood, which went public late last month, were credited for a price surge after they were publicized in late July and early August. The stock jumped more than 50 percent on Aug. 4.  ''The golden touch of Cathie Wood continues to carry a lot of weight,'' wrote Chris Vecchio, a market analyst with DailyFX.com, in a client note.  More Money, More Scrutiny  As Ms. Wood has attracted more attention, money and power to move markets, those scrutinizing her company argue that Ark's unique structure may be creating risks for its investors -- not to mention her online disciples.  Ms. Wood is the sole portfolio manager overseeing almost $85 billion in assets. She represents what's known as ''key man risk'' -- essentially the chance that illness, accident, death or something else renders an important leader unable to perform. Many investors would flee Ark if Ms. Wood wasn't at the helm.  She may also be a victim of her own success. Ark has far more money to invest than it did just 18 months ago, and spending it poses a challenge. The kind of technology stocks the company has traditionally favored are small and lightly traded, so big bets can move their prices sharply. Ark risks bidding the price up when it buys, then taking a big hit when it sells because such stocks often have few buyers.  Also, many of the stocks that Ms. Wood buys appear highly correlated -- they go up together -- which worked out well last year. But they also go down together, exposing her to crushing losses when market conditions turn against her.  Investors got a sneak peek of what such an ugly sell-off might look like this year. The flagship Ark Innovation fund plunged more than 35 percent between February and May -- far worse than the market -- as investors began to favor traditional sectors that were poised to benefit from the economic recovery.  Recent volatility -- partly a result of the rise of the Delta variant of the coronavirus and concerns about an uneven recovery -- has helped Ms. Wood's fund recover somewhat, but the Ark Innovation fund is still down about 7 percent for the year. In comparison, the Nasdaq is up roughly 14 percent and the S&P 500 about 18 percent.  But her funds' lackluster showing this year pales next to last year's surge. And the niche that has become almost synonymous with Ark -- actively managed, fully transparent exchange-traded funds -- is one of the fastest-growing parts of the money management business.  Over the past year, investors dumped about $110 billion into the kinds of actively traded funds that disclose their holdings daily, analysts at J.P. Morgan said in a recent research report, noting that such huge inflows demonstrate that ''portfolio transparency need not be an impediment to the success of an active E.T.F. strategy.''  On Wall Street, major firms are rushing in to siphon off their share of those investor dollars. Late last year, the world's largest money manager BlackRock, added three transparent funds -- which disclose positions daily -- to its offerings. Just last month, Goldman Sachs Asset Management began selling its first transparent, actively managed version of an E.T.F. JPMorgan Chase's asset management group also announced plans this month to convert four of its mutual funds into ''active transparent'' E.T.F.s, along the lines of Ark's offerings.  Others are predicting that Ms. Wood's luck is about to run out. Recent filings from some prominent hedge funds showed they had been purchasing 'puts' -- bets that make money when the price of an investment declines -- against her fund during the second quarter.  For her part, she continues to look for new opportunities. In May, as tech stocks were tumbling and cryptocurrencies took a nosedive, she said on Bloomberg News that Bitcoin could rise to $500,000 over the next five years. It is currently trading around $45,000.  Her firm has also filed plans with regulators to start a Bitcoin-themed E.T.F. that would track the performance of the S&P Bitcoin index.  And even though her funds are lagging the rest of the market, Ms. Wood stresses that her belief in her picks is remain steadfast.  Recent months had been difficult for her clients, she acknowledged to her interviewer. But in the next breath, she hastened a bit of advice.  ''Keep the faith,'' she said.

"Document NYTF000020210731eh7v0003e","Editorial Desk; SECTA","We're All Tesla's Guinea Pigs","By Greg Bensinger","1054 words","31 July 2021","The New York Times","NYTF","Late Edition - Final","18",NA,"English","Copyright 2021 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.","One of the greatest tricks technology companies ever played was convincing their human guinea pig users that they were a privileged group called beta testers.  From novel email software to alternative versions of Twitter to voice-enabled listening devices, such trials are cheap and easy to make available to thousands or millions of customers. It's a great way to see how a new version stacks up against the old.","Other than some annoying glitches or unfamiliar icons, software beta testing is generally innocuous. The stakes for most apps are far below life and death.  But there's nothing innocuous about the beta tests being run by Elon Musk, the billionaire C.E.O. of Tesla. He has turned American streets into a public laboratory for the company's supposed self-driving car technology.  Tesla says that its inaccurately named full self-driving and autopilot modes are meant to assist drivers and make Teslas safer -- but autopilot has been at the center of a series of erratic driving incidents.  In public, Mr. Musk sometimes overhypes these technologies on social media and in other statements. Yet Tesla engineers have privately admitted to California regulators that they are not quite ready for prime time.  Tesla's autopilot mode uses software, sensors and cameras to detect lanes, objects and other vehicles on the road and can steer, brake, accelerate and even change lanes with minimal input from the driver. Full self-driving beta version 9 -- available today to just a few thousand Tesla owners -- is supposed to assist with more complicated driving on local streets.  Mr. Musk has assured buyers of his electric vehicles that they would have ''full self-driving, software, everything,'' yet the autos are not fully self-driving, nor do they have anything like a real autopilot.  This kind of experimental technology, in the hands of regular drivers, has caused multiple fiery crashes and may have other fatal flaws, like an inability to distinguish the moon from a yellow traffic light. Autopilot, features of which must be activated by the driver, has come installed in all new Teslas since 2016. The technology is the subject of multiple lawsuits, including allegations of false advertising.  Mr. Musk tweeted this month, ''Beta 9 addresses most known issues, but there will be unknown issues, so please be paranoid. Safety is always top priority at Tesla.'' Safety may be a top priority at the factory, but out on the public roads, it's not only Tesla drivers who have a vested interest in the safety of the vehicles.  On Tesla's quarterly earnings call this week, Mr. Musk appeared to acknowledge that full self-driving is still half-baked. ''We need to make full self-driving work in order for it to be a compelling value proposition,'' he said of the technology, when asked about the $199 monthly fee to access it when Tesla releases it to a wider swath of drivers.  Tesla drivers may fall victim to a version of what's known in clinical drug trials as therapeutic misconception, in which trial participants (beta testers, in this case) tend to overlook the potential risks of participating in an experiment, mistakenly regarding themselves as consumers of a finished product rather than as guinea pigs. And with self-driving cars, Tesla owners aren't the only trial participants.  Consumer Reports has raised serious alarms about the safety of Tesla vehicles using the automated systems. Videos of full self-driving in action ''don't show a system that makes driving safer or even less stressful,'' said a Consumer Reports official. ''Consumers are simply paying to be test engineers for developing technology without adequate safety protection.'' This is simple: The cars are a hazard to pedestrians, cyclists and other drivers. Which makes it all the more alarming that the internet is full of videos of Tesla drivers reading books, checking email, leaving the driver's seat or snoozing behind the wheel.  In other words, Teslas appear to be a risk to drivers and others on the road when a computer is behind the wheel. The National Transportation Safety Board has criticized autopilot for lacking proper means to prevent driver misuse and effective driver monitoring systems. That should have all Americans concerned that their public streets are a testing ground.  Competitors like General Motors Co.'s Cruise and Alphabet's Waymo have taken a more measured approach, putting paid employees behind the wheel as a safety check while the cars are tested in real-world environments. At least they have no misconceptions about what's going on. Unlike Teslas, those vehicles are easily identifiable as prototypes on the road, giving drivers of other cars a chance to steer clear.  When engineers say the autonomous systems aren't yet ready, regulators should listen. Only this year did the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration begin requiring tracking and regular monthly reporting of crashes involving autonomous vehicles, perhaps a step toward more regulation. The agency has also ongoing investigations into about three dozen crashes involving vehicles using driver-assistance systems. The vast majority of those involved Teslas, including 10 fatalities.  Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment.  Self-driving vehicles hold tremendous promise to improve traffic safety. Humans are surprisingly bad at driving. Autonomous vehicles don't drink and drive, and one day they may be able to see better than the human eye, to respond more quickly to sudden movements from other cars on the road and to lower costs for long-haul trucking operations, among other benefits. But the technology isn't there yet.  Putting it on the road before it is ready risks not only lives now but also swift public acceptance of the technology down the road when it is ready. If Tesla wants to run beta tests with human guinea pigs, it should do so on a closed track. We'd all feel safer.  The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

"Document NYTF000020210715eh7e0000i","Business/Financial Desk; SECTB","Does the Route To Driverless Cars Start in Germany?","By Jack Ewing","1254 words","14 July 2021","The New York Times","NYTF","Late Edition - Final","1",NA,"English","Copyright 2021 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.","A new law allows autonomous vehicles in everyday use and provides legal consistency lacking in the United States.  FRANKFURT -- In Hamburg, a fleet of electric Volkswagen vans owned by a ride-hailing service roams the streets picking up and dropping off passengers. The vehicles steer themselves, but technicians working from a remote control center keep an eye on their progress with the help of video monitors. If anything goes wrong, they can take control of the vehicle and steer it out of trouble.","This futuristic vision, within reach of current technology, is about to become legal in Germany. The Parliament in Berlin approved a new law on autonomous driving in May, and it awaits the signature of Germany's president, a formality. The law opens a path for companies to start making money from autonomous driving services, which could also spur development.  With its requirement that autonomous vehicles be overseen by humans, the German law reflects a realization in the industry that researchers are still years away from cars that can safely allow the driver to disengage while the car does all the work. The law also requires that autonomous vehicles operate in a defined space approved by the authorities, an acknowledgment that the technology is not advanced enough to work safely in areas where traffic is chaotic and unpredictable.  So German companies that are pursuing the technology have adjusted their ambitions, focusing on moneymaking uses that don't require major breakthroughs.  Germany's nationwide approach contrasts with the patchwork of state laws in the United States. The U.S. government has issued guidelines for autonomous driving, but attempts to establish mandatory rules that would apply in all 50 states have foundered in Congress amid disagreement among automakers and autonomous driving developers about what the legislation should say.  Some states have encouraged autonomous driving research; Arizona allows Waymo, for example, to offer driverless taxis in Phoenix. But it's not yet possible to roll out such services nationwide, achieving the kind of scale that would help make them profitable.  ''Germany is unique in the sense that you now have a law that pertains to the entire country,'' said Elliot Katz, the chief business officer of Phantom Auto, a California company that provides software to monitor and control vehicles remotely. ''In the U.S., we do not have any overarching federal autonomous driving regulation. We have state laws, which is problematic because driving is inherently interstate.''  The German legislation could also give the country's automakers an edge in the race to design cars that can drive themselves. By deploying autonomous vehicles commercially, they will gather large amounts of data they can use to advance the technology. If the services are profitable, they will also help pay for further development.  ''There are two major topics for the German car manufacturers: the change to electric cars and autonomous driving,'' said Moritz Hüsch, a partner at the Covington law firm in Frankfurt who has followed the legislation. ''The German car manufacturers are one of our crown jewels. They are really keen to get at the forefront of both topics.''  The law permits autonomous vehicles that remain within a defined territory and are overseen by trained technicians. Crucially, it allows the monitors to keep tabs on numerous vehicles remotely. That means a person or team could supervise a fleet of autonomous shuttle vans or self-driving taxis by video from a command center, eliminating the need for a supervisor in every vehicle. In case of trouble, a technician would be able to take control of the vehicle from afar.  Proponents say the law will allow autonomous buses to serve rural areas where public transportation is scarce. Other services might include automated valet parking or robot package delivery. Autonomous vehicles could be used to transport components or workers around a factory complex or students around a university.  Vehicles already exist that can navigate a predictable course, such as from an airport parking lot to a departure terminal, but existing German law requires a human to be on board, which cancels out any cost savings from eliminating the driver.  If a driver can oversee a dozen buses from a command center, ''there are use cases that would now be attractive,'' said Peter Liggesmeyer, director of the Fraunhofer Institute for Experimental Software Engineering in Kaiserslautern. That will encourage more development, he said.  In technical jargon, the new law allows Level 4 autonomous driving, in which a vehicle can steer and navigate by itself most of the time but may occasionally require human intervention. That is one step away from the autonomous driving nirvana of cars that can operate without any human help.  Volkswagen, for example, has been testing a ride-sharing service in Hamburg and Hanover called Moia. The new law makes it easier for Volkswagen to achieve its goal of converting Moia's electric vans to autonomous operation by 2025, though further changes in the country's public transport law may also be needed.  ''The use of self-driving vehicles in Germany is now possible,'' said Christian Senger, a senior vice president at Volkswagen's commercial vehicles division responsible for autonomous driving, in a statement. ''That is something that not only Volkswagen but all market participants have been waiting for.''  Technology companies like Waymo or carmakers like Toyota have invested billions of dollars in autonomous driving technology, but have yet to see much return on their investment. Uber sold its self-driving unit last year after investing more than $1 billion. Fatal crashes involving Tesla's Autopilot software have raised questions about the technology's shortcomings.  Whether a uniform legal framework will give German companies a decisive edge over American companies is another question. That was the intent.  ''Germany can be the first country in the world to bring vehicles without drivers from the laboratory into everyday use,'' Arno Klare, a Social Democratic member of Parliament, said during debate about the law in Berlin.  In the United States, as soon as an autonomous vehicle tries to cross states lines, things get complicated. California, Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania are considered leaders in providing legal parameters for autonomous driving technology. But 10 states, including New Jersey, Rhode Island and Maryland, have not enacted laws or issued executive orders governing autonomous driving, according to the National Conference of State Legislators. Rules in other states have not followed a consistent template.  Raj Rajkumar, who leads the autonomous driving program at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, which has produced many of the leading scientists in the field, said the new legislation would give German companies an advantage. But he said he was concerned that the United States and Europe were both at risk of falling behind China in technology and regulations.  ''There is an international arms race between the U.S., Europe and China,'' said Mr. Rajkumar, who estimates that fully autonomous vehicles are still a decade away. ''China is an authoritarian country. They can pass any rules they want overnight.''   ART 	 An electric van operated by Moia, a ride-sharing service Volkswagen is testing in Hamburg, Germany.

All Rights Reserved.","AGRICULTURE Minority Farmers to Get Debt Relief Payments The United States Department of Agriculture said on Friday that it will begin making loan forgiveness payments in June to thousands of minority farmers as part of the Biden administration's $4 billion debt relief program. The initiative, part of the $1.9 trillion economic relief package that Congress passed in March, has been criticized by white farmers, who claim that it is a form of reverse discrimination, and by banks, which have complained they are losing out on profits from lost interest payments. Delays in implementing the program have frustrated Black farmer organizations, whose members have struggled financially for years and received little help from the Trump administration's farm bailouts last year. The U.S.D.A. will initially make debt relief payments for about 13,000 loans that were made directly by the agency to minority farmers.","The next phase will apply to the approximately 3,000 loans that were made by banks and guaranteed by the U.S.D.A. That will begin ''no later'' than 120 days from Friday, the agency said. ALAN RAPPEPORT AUTOMOBILES Ford Boss Urges U.S. Set Rules for Automated Cars The chief executive of Ford, America's second-largest auto company, is calling for the federal government to set standards for fully or partially automated vehicles to tighten the safety of electronic driving systems. In urging federal regulation, the C.E.O., Jim Farley, right, becomes the highest-profile auto executive to publicly recognize a need to more closely monitor the emerging technology, which is becoming more prevalent on America's roadways as questions are being raised about the potential risks to motorists. Companies are beginning to deploy fully autonomous ride-hailing services. Mr. Farley's statements in an interview follow increased scrutiny by regulators of Tesla's partially automated ''Autopilot'' driver-assist system, which has been involved in a series of high-profile crashes. He suggested legislators and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration were moving too slowly. Mr. Farley said Argo AI, a company in which Ford is a major investor, is moving quickly with technology that will let Ford start an autonomous ridehailing service next year. And later this year, Ford will offer ''Blue Cruise,'' its own partly automated highway driving system.

All Rights Reserved.","The much-discussed Tesla and SpaceX executive took a self-deprecating approach, telling viewers, ''I'm pretty good at running human in emulation mode.''  In the end, an episode of ''Saturday Night Live'' hosted by Elon Musk turned out to be exactly that, no more and no less.","Musk, the billionaire chief executive of Tesla and founder of SpaceX, appeared in several ''S.N.L.'' sketches this weekend, playing characters that included a doctor at a hospital that caters to Generation Z patients, the producer of an Icelandic TV talk show and the video game villain Wario.  He used his opening monologue to share some personal details about himself, introducing viewers to his mother and discussing his diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome -- and to gratuitously plug a cryptocurrency.  [Video: Watch on YouTube.]  Sure, a couple of sketches felt a little eager to polish Musk's public image, like a filmed segment that cast him as the mission commander of an effort to save a Martian colony running dangerously low on oxygen. (Meanwhile, it was up to Pete Davidson, playing his hapless doofus character, Chad, to save the day on the red planet.)  Even so, Musk's presence didn't stop ''S.N.L.'' from taking a few satirical potshots at him.  Colin Jost, the ''Weekend Update'' anchor, noted during that portion of the show that debris from a Chinese rocket had crashed into the Indian Ocean only a short while earlier.  ''And for once,'' Jost said, ''we know it's not Elon's fault. A lot of people have been wondering, Why is he hosting our show? And now we know it's because he needed an alibi.''  Musk took what opportunities he could to humanize himself to the ''S.N.L.'' audience. As he said in his monologue: ''To anyone I've offended, I just wanted to say, I reinvented electric cars and I'm sending people to Mars on a rocket ship. Did you think I was also going to be a chill, normal dude?''  [Video: Watch on YouTube.]  The lead-up to this weekend's broadcast was like few, if any, in ''S.N.L.'' history. Not long after it was announced that Musk would be hosting, some of the show's cast members went on social media to register their dissent.  Bowen Yang posted a frowny-face emoji on his Instagram story. Aidy Bryant used her account to publish a tweet from Senator Bernie Sanders, in which he wrote that ''the 50 wealthiest people in this country own more wealth than some 165 MILLION Americans'' -- a phenomenon Sanders described as ''a moral obscenity.''  Other cast members voiced their support for Musk and said they were excited to have him on the show. Michael Che said in a radio interview with the Breakfast Club that the debate over Musk was ''a good thing.''  ''I think it means people still care about the show in some way, at least,'' Che added.  Musk himself was busy generating plenty of headlines in recent weeks: Tesla posted record quarterly earnings in April. A team of four astronauts completed a nighttime splashdown at the start of the month, returning to Earth in a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft after a mission that sent them to the International Space Station. On Wednesday, a prototype of a SpaceX rocket successfully landed during a test flight in Texas, after other such crafts had exploded in previous tests.  Not all of the headlines have been positive. SpaceX has also come into conflict with residents of Boca Chica, Tex., who say they have been pressured to sell their properties as the company expands its operations there. And Tesla's Autopilot technology has come under scrutiny, including in an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration into about two dozen car accidents involving Teslas.  [Video: Watch on YouTube.]  Musk took a self-deprecating tone in his ''S.N.L.'' monologue, telling the audience: ''Sometimes, after I say something, I have to say, 'I mean that,' so people really know that I mean it. That's because I don't always have a lot of intonational variation in how I speak. Which I'm told makes for great comedy.''  He also described himself as ''the first person with Asperger's to host 'S.N.L.' -- or at least the first to admit it.'' (Dan Aykroyd, the ''S.N.L.'' alum and former host, has also said that he was given a diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome in the 1980s.)  ''Don't worry,'' Musk added. ''I'm pretty good at running human in emulation mode.''  Musk's mother, Maye Musk, joined her son onstage after an opening sketch led by the week's musical guest, Miley Cyrus, that featured members of the ''S.N.L.'' cast alongside their mothers.  Wondering what her Mother's Day gift might be, Maye Musk said, ''I just hope it's not Dogecoin,'' referring to the cryptocurrency that Elon Musk has frequently touted.  ''It is,'' her son told her. (Despite Elon Musk's mentioning Dogecoin here and in a ''Weekend Update'' segment, the price of the cryptocurrency declined during the ''S.N.L.'' broadcast.)  Cocktail chatter of the week  [Video: Watch on YouTube.]  Let's take it as an optimistic sign that ''S.N.L.'' is now producing sketches about what post-pandemic life might look like.  That category includes this filmed segment about a party where guests find themselves navigating all the awkward conversations that come up when you run into people you haven't seen in months. While Kate McKinnon tells Beck Bennett she went through some ups and downs, she thinks to herself: ''Ups and downs? You stabbed your husband with a screwdriver.'' (Bennett, meanwhile, is thinking that the pandemic ''affected me zero'' as he licks his hand and plunges it into a bowl of party snacks.)  Musk availed himself reasonably well, playing a character who tries to make small talk with Heidi Gardner about which Covid-19 vaccines they received.  Weekend Update jokes of the week  [Video: Watch on YouTube.]  Over at the ''Weekend Update'' desk, the anchors Jost and Che, also mocked news developments in the lives of prominent politicians like former President Trump, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and President Biden.  Jost started in on Trump:  A prominent white nationalist has begun posting manifestoes online. Oh, I'm sorry, that was the sub-headline. The headline was, ''Donald Trump Launches New Blog.'' That's right, disgraced former fast-food spokesman Donald Trump has launched a website called From the Desk of Donald J. Trump. Though a more accurate name would be, From the Brain Fog of Long-Haul Covid. I don't understand why the Republican Party is still betting their entire future on Trump. He turns 75 next month. It's like getting your family an old dog and saying, ''Hey kids, invest all your emotions in this.''  Che later teased the current leadership, saying, ''Kamala Harris will become the first vice president to be featured as a wax figure at Madame Tussauds wax museum, while Joe Biden is the first wax figure to become president.''  Jost soon turned the subject to Cuomo, adding: ''New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that Broadway could reopen on September 14. Except for the new musical about Cuomo's handling of the pandemic, 'Nursinghoma!'''  Fake TV promo of the week  [Video: Watch on YouTube.]  If you can't get enough of Kate Winslet's efforts at a regional Pennsylvania accent the HBO limited series ''Mare of Easttown'' (or if you just appreciate her describing the local Wawa convenience-store chain as ''a mythical place''), has ''S.N.L.'' got the show for you.  Their answer, offered in this filmed fake commercial, stars McKinnon as a similarly rugged cop investigating the killing of a young woman that provides the series with its title, ''Murder Durdur.'' (As she forcefully declares to a perplexed fellow investigator at the crime scene: ''Did I sturdur? The durdur's been murdered!'')  Look out for the Philadelphia Flyers mascot, Gritty; a pretzel vape; and Musk as the crime's obvious culprit.

All Rights Reserved.","TEN LESSONS FOR A POST-PANDEMIC WORLD  By Fareed Zakaria","Oh, no, not a book about the pandemic just a few months into Covid-19. Not another series of snapshots overtaken by tomorrow's events. Fareed Zakaria, a CNN host with a Ph.D. from Harvard, does not fall into this trap.  Wisely, he stays away from the daily battles over masks and lockdowns. Nor is doom-mongering his business. Instead ''Ten Lessons for a Post-Pandemic World'' employs a wide lens, drawing on governance, economics and culture. Call it ''applied history.'' What insights does it offer during a catastrophe that evokes the Spanish flu after World War I, which claimed 50 million -- some reckon 100 million -- lives?  That story comes with a word of caution about historical analogies. Zakaria ascribes ''seismic effects'' to such cataclysms. Ancient Athens, a proud democracy, never recovered from the plague. The late-medieval Black Death all but wiped out Europe with a toll between 75 million and 200 million. Yet note that it was estimated to have run for 100 years. The Spanish flu trickled away after two. As mortality soared in the United States, the economy dropped by only 3.5 percent. It took until the 1930s before we could actually see a virus under the electron microscope. Today, SARS-CoV-2 was sequenced almost instantaneously.  The past, then, is like the Sphinx with her ambiguous advice. Not only has science learned a few things. So have governments, which went for penny-pinching and deflation after the Crash of 1929, but now pour out trillions.  Having laid out a ''gloomy compendium of threats,'' Zakaria rightly celebrates ''our resilient world.'' States actually ''gain strength through chaos and crises.'' He also dispatches the facile notion that despots like China's Xi Jinping do better than democratic leaders. We owe the coronavirus's leap around the globe to China's suppression of lifesaving data; thereafter, the police state took over. Khamenei's Iran and Erdogan's Turkey performed badly, and so did Brazil, ruled by a would-be caudillo.  [ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of October. See the full list . ]  The democracies did not succumb to authoritarianism, but neither is there any clear pattern. At least until recently Germany, Denmark and Austria performed best, Belgium, Sweden and the United Kingdom worst. Taiwan and South Korea quickly contained the virus without totalitarian tactics. The United States is so-so, near the bottom of the Top 10 in deaths per million. So, what are the lessons?  What matters is not the ideological coloration of government or its size, but its quality, Zakaria says. He argues for ''a competent, well-functioning, trusted state.'' Sweden is all that, but also high up on the League Table of Death. The United States has proved neither competent nor cohesive. It is an archipelago of some 2,600 federal, state and local authorities charged with health policy.  Yet federal Germany, with its ancient history of decentralization, is also a hodgepodge and still shines forth. The ur-model of the strong state is France. In terms of deaths per million, it ranks far above confederate Switzerland, with its 26 cantons jealously holding off Berne.  So, what is good governance? An efficient bureaucracy like Prussia's, infused with the spirit of freedom rooted in the American Creed? Beyond your small-town D.M.V., the United States seems to enjoy neither. Social Security is superb, Veterans Affairs a disaster. Meanwhile, officialdom has grown exponentially in a supposedly ''anti-statist'' country. America, Zakaria says, must learn ''not big or small, but good government.'' Amen to that -- though not forgetting Churchill's quip that the United States will eventually do the right thing after exhausting all the alternatives.  Zakaria lays out the road from the pandemic to the transcendence of America the Dysfunctional. The to-do list is long. Upward mobility is down, inequality is up. The universities of the United States lead the global pack, but a B.A. at one of those top schools comes with a price tag upward of a quarter-million dollars. The country boasts the best medical establishment, but health care for the masses might just as well dwell on the moon.  We should adopt the best practices of northern Europe, Zakaria counsels. Like Sweden long ago, Denmark is the new Promised Land, even when compared with the rest of Europe. Striking a wondrous balance between efficiency, market economics and equality, those great Danes embody an inspiring model; alas, it is hard to transfer. A small and homogeneous country on the edge of world politics, Denmark is the very opposite of the United States. Maybe its people should occupy America for a couple of generations to reform 330 million über-diverse citizens.  The world's troubles are not just Made in U.S.A., Zakaria rightly notes. They are rooted in ultramodernity: globalization, automation, alienation, mass migration, the lure and decay of the world's sprawling metropolises. These are the stuff of misery -- and the fare of cultural critics since the dawn of the industrial age.  With his lively language and to-the-point examples, Zakaria tells the story well, while resisting boilerplate as served up by the left and the right. Nor does he spare his own liberal class, the ''meritocracy'' of the best educated and better off, which he fingers ever so gently as deepening the divide between urban and rural, elites and ''deplorables.'' He might have said a bit more about the uses and abuses of cultural hegemony that have driven hoi polloi into the arms of Donald Trump and triggered defections from the democratic left in Europe.  The book's central message comes in the last paragraph: ''This ugly pandemic has ... opened up a path to a new world.'' Which one? The gist of Zakaria's program is revealed by a recent editorial in The Financial Times, which he quotes approvingly. That newspaper was once a cheerleader of global capitalism. Now it argues that ''many rich societies'' do not honor ''a social contract that benefits everyone.'' So, the neoliberalism of decades past must yield to ''radical reforms.'' Governments ''will have to accept a more active role in the economy. They must see public services as investments. ... Redistribution will again be on the agenda; the privileges of the ... wealthy in question.'' Now is the time for ''basic income and wealth taxes.''  Not bad for a supposedly capitalist mouthpiece. Yet this should not come as a surprise. Both The Financial Times and Zakaria's book urge a revolution already upon us, and probably represent today's zeitgeist and reality. Free-market economics à la Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher have had a nice run since the 1980s. These days, Covid-19 is merely accelerating the mental turn engendered by the 2008 financial crisis. We are all social democrats now.  Government in the West is back with industrial policy and trillions in cash. It is not a radical, but a consensual project. Taxation, a tool of redistribution, will rise along with border walls. For the more perfect welfare state can flourish only in a well-fenced world that brakes the influx of competing people and products.  If that mends the miserable American health, transportation and public education system without cutting into the country's dynamism, then more power to the spendthrift. Still, ''writing checks,'' Zakaria warns, sometimes ''goes badly.'' Especially if it feeds consumption, not investment. Or favors giga-corporations. After half a lifetime of retraction from the economy, big government is back -- and looks as if it will stay. But beware of what you wish for.  Meanwhile, read ''Ten Lessons.'' It is an intelligent, learned and judicious guide for a world already in the making. May we all be as smart as the Danes. They have marvelously combined welfarism and individual responsibility. But they have not invented the PC, MRT, iPhone or Tesla, not to speak of Post-its and the microwave popcorn bag.

"Document NYTF000020201013egad0002t","Business/Financial Desk; SECTB","Britain Gets Set For Race To Space","By Stanley Reed","1647 words","13 October 2020","The New York Times","NYTF","Late Edition - Final","1",NA,"English","Copyright 2020 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.","Cornwall, in England's far southwest, is known for antique fishing villages and snug, cliff-lined beaches. Soon it may be the scene of something very different: a small but growing space industry.  One day in a year or two, a modified Boeing 747 is expected to lift off from the long runway at the region's airport, head out over the Atlantic Ocean and soar into the stratosphere. There, a rocket will drop from below a wing, fire its engines and ferry a load of small satellites into orbit, while the plane returns to the airport.","After six years of planning and fund-raising, construction of a bare-bones spaceport, budgeted at about 22 million pounds ($28 million), is beginning this month at the airport in Newquay.  The anchor tenant is expected to be Virgin Orbit, a part of Richard Branson's Virgin universe. Its selling point: Putting satellites into orbit via aircraft can be done faster and with less infrastructure than earthbound rockets. It plans to bring its 747 (called the Cosmic Girl) and other gear being tested in the Mojave Desert to Britain with the help of £7.35 million from the U.K. Space Agency .  ''At the beginning, people laughed at us,'' said Melissa Thorpe, head of engagement for Spaceport Cornwall, the developer. ''It took a lot of work to convince a lot of people.''  Among the better arguments: The spaceport, which is owned by the local government, could eventually provide 150 good jobs in what, despite its charm, is a region dependent on low-paid, seasonal work from tourism.  Britain is doubling down on the always risky space business after, some would say, years of neglect. Besides Cornwall, the government is putting money behind several other potential launch sites, including one on the remote north coast of Scotland, which is being tailored for an environmentally friendly rocket to be manufactured nearby.  This is all new for a country that does not have a deep history of rocketry or launching satellites into space. The case for spaceports in Britain is far from proven. In fact, some analysts say there are already too many such facilities, including in the United States.  The first -- and, to date, only -- British-made satellite-bearing rocket was launched from Woomera in Australia in 1971. That program, called Black Arrow, was scrapped after four launches for not being cost effective.  ''You do have to pinch yourself that the U.K is within a few years of launching satellites,'' said Doug Millard, space curator at the Science Museum in London . ''That is something that never would have been considered not so long ago.''  A big reason for the turnaround is Brexit. The decision to pull away from the European Union has heightened awareness that Britain, which has largely relied on European and American space programs for services like satellite navigation, would be at risk without its own space infrastructure. This year the space agency's budget was bumped up 10 percent to £556 million (still a small fraction of NASA 's $22 billion).  Brexit has provided ''a real stimulus to get us to think about what we actually need as a country in space,'' said Graham Turnock, chief executive of the U.K. Space Agency, in an interview.  But the decision to look skyward also coincides with the growing commercial use of space around the world, promoted by deep-pocketed investors like Elon Musk , Jeff Bezos and Mr. Branson, but also pushed along by a range of less prominent entrepreneurs and businesses.  Key has been the emergence of much smaller and cheaper satellites, some the size of a shoe box and costing a relatively small $1 million or less. Some are used for observation, such as measuring how much oil is stored in a tank farm, valuable data for energy investors. Others are planned to provide internet connectivity on earth and a key link in the burgeoning internet of things, essential for self-driving cars and smart kitchens.  ''We are right at the beginning of this journey,'' said Mark Boggett, chief executive of London-based Seraphim Capital, which is managing a $90 million space fund.  The government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson put its own chips on such efforts by agreeing in July to spend £500 million to acquire 45 percent of OneWeb, a satellite operator.  OneWeb filed for bankruptcy this year, but is involved in the hottest area of the satellite industry: the creation of so-called constellations, blizzards of coordinated satellites in low orbit, designed to provide blanket coverage for purposes like extending the internet to remote regions.  OneWeb is building its satellites at a factory co-owned by Airbus in Florida. The hope in the British government and space community is that OneWeb will build a future generation of satellites in Britain.  Over all, the government is trying to support activity in what is known as ''new space,'' a more agile and commercial approach to an industry traditionally dominated by government and military programs.  ''OneWeb, and what we are doing on launch, is all about taking a really big role in that new economy,'' Mr. Turnock said.  While Britain has participated in prestigious space activities like making a Mars rover for an upcoming European-Russian mission, it has catching up to do. Still, space experts say the direction the industry is moving could play to its advantage.  The launch vehicles that Britain is trying to nurture would be suited for smaller satellites that operate in low-Earth orbit, around 800 miles up, compared with about 22,000 miles for telecommunications giants that sometimes cost hundreds of millions of dollars.  Smaller satellites also have much shorter life spans than the larger ones, implying the need for more of them, and more launches. Virgin Orbit says it plans to charge $12 million to take a nearly 700-pound payload of satellites into space.  Having nearby launch sites will fill a need for companies like In-Space Missions, a space service firm in Hampshire, outside London. Doug Liddle, the chief executive, said the company went all the way to New Zealand to launch a satellite this year, only to lose it when the rocket failed.  The new space economy is also more affordable for medium-size countries like Britain. ''The small-satellite approach now means we are not going to spend our entire national budget on our space program,'' said Martin Sweeting , a founder and executive chairman of a British university spinoff called Surrey Satellite Technology , a pioneer in small satellites.  Space is also becoming far more accessible to start-ups like Open Cosmos, which offers to build satellites and arrange their launch and early operation at a cost of $10 million or less. The company is one of many technology businesses clustered in Harwell, a community near the University of Oxford .  Among the neighbors are clients like Lacuna Space, which plans to deploy satellites for a range of uses like tracking cattle on vast Latin American ranches, and potential suppliers like Oxford Space Systems, which builds satellite-mounted antennas that unfurl once in orbit to send data to ground receivers.  ''It is a small ecosystem; everybody knows each other,'' said Rafel Jordá Siquier, the 31-year-old founder of Open Cosmos.  But not all the companies are start-ups. Airbus , the giant French maker of commercial aircraft, is also a major manufacturer of satellites and employs 3,500 people doing space work in Britain.  The company had been nervous about Brexit's implications for those operations, but the government's move into OneWeb offered some reassurance.  ''The investment in OneWeb and focus of the U.K. on space is actually making Airbus go, 'Look, the U.K. is a really good place to invest,''' said Richard Franklin, head of space and defense for Britain at Airbus .  That said, Britain's ambitions face large unknowns and risks.  The launch technologies it is counting on are unproven. Virgin Orbit's first test this year in the United States sputtered when the main rocket engine shut down. And the coronavirus pandemic has put huge financial strain on Mr. Branson's empire, including the flagship, Virgin Atlantic . To help bolster the finances of the airline and other companies, the entrepreneur sold around $500 million of shares in Virgin Galactic, a space tourism business.  But Will Pomerantz, Virgin Orbit's vice president for special projects, said the 747 would come to Cornwall ''when they are ready and they need us.''  The satellite market is also both competitive and turbulent. Tesla's founder, Elon Musk , whose SpaceX has carried U.S. astronauts to the International Space Station and returned them safely to Earth, is building his own mega constellation satellite system, Starlink. Other technology companies are likely to follow, while many countries can now build satellites.  ''One of the beautiful things about small sats is that anyone can make one,'' said Alexandre Najjar, senior consultant at Euroconsult, a market research firm.  Still, Britain's space entrepreneurs say having a launchpad near home might give them an edge.  ''If we can get in a van and drive our spacecraft up to Scotland or Cornwall, the whole process becomes much more straightforward,'' said Mr. Liddle, the satellite builder.

"Document NYTF000020200828eg8s00051","Business/Financial Desk; SECTB","First Step for Electric Trucks? The Last Mile","By Jim Motavalli","1761 words","28 August 2020","The New York Times","NYTF","Late Edition - Final","6",NA,"English","Copyright 2020 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.","With deliveries surging during the pandemic, carriers like UPS and FedEx and companies like Amazon are renewing their push toward electric vehicles.  Going back years, you might have been able to spot a truck from the likes of FedEx and UPS, and more recently Amazon, that ran on electricity. But most of these were small, short test runs that left the internal-combustion status quo in place.","Now that battery technology is catching up to ambitions, many companies are making big commitments to electrify the last delivery mile, typically from transportation hub to destination. The momentum means that plugging in the fleet may happen well before another vaunted goal -- self-driving -- is reached. Success is not guaranteed, though. The companies are eager to buy, but they will need the latest in battery-powered trucks, and a lot of them.  The rush to electrify, prompted by concern about climate change, a chance to offset growing delivery costs, government regulation and big advances in battery technology, is occurring as the coronavirus pandemic has caused a huge spike in package delivery. UPS, for instance, was delivering up to 21.1 million packages a day in the second quarter, a nearly 23 percent jump in average daily U.S. volume from a year earlier. Avery Vise, vice president for trucking at FTR Transportation Intelligence, said big increases in delivery truck orders hadn't shown up yet, but they're very likely coming.  ''The rise in e-commerce is increasing demand for electric delivery vans,'' said Tim Denoyer, vice president and senior analyst at ACT Research, a forecaster and consulting company specializing in commercial vehicles. ''And because of three factors -- the short length of operation, the ability to return to a central base, and frequent stops and starts that work well with regenerative braking -- the duty cycle works well with electric.''  In an estimate before the pandemic, Statista said the North American last-mile delivery market was $31.25 billion in 2018, but would reach just under $51 billion in 2022. The incentives to electrify that market are partly financial. The Bloomberg New Energy Finance ''Electric Vehicle Outlook 2020'' predicts that, by the mid-2020s, even without subsidies, E.V.s will be at cost parity with their polluting counterparts in most segments.  Mr. Denoyer said that was happening already. ''In short local delivery operations, the cost economics for electric are now better than diesel in some cases,'' he said.  With more deliveries to make, the carriers will need more trucks. Compared with, say, compact S.U.V.s or full-size pickups, it's a niche market, but it's growing and new players are arriving.  Robert Bollinger, chief executive of Bollinger Motors, has a battery-powered S.U.V. and pickup planned for late 2021. In an interview, he revealed that the company was also exploring a third vehicle, a midsize Class 3 delivery van with at least 200-mile range that will be built with a manufacturing partner.  ''We can get to market quicker that way,'' Mr. Bollinger said.  Like Bollinger, the Michigan-based start-up Rivian -- with large investments from Ford, Amazon and others totaling $6 billion -- has announced an electric pickup (R1T) and an S.U.V. (R1S), with vehicles reaching customers starting in 2021. But by 2022 it is also planning to deliver the first 10,000 of what by 2030 will be 100,000 delivery trucks for Amazon.  ''We worked closely with our shareholder Amazon to develop a vehicle optimized in terms of efficiency, driver ingress and driver comfort for last-mile delivery,'' the chief executive, R.J. Scaringe, said in an interview. The vans will be built alongside the other Rivian vehicles in a former Mitsubishi plant in Normal, Ill.  Rivian's initial plan, in 2009, was to build a sports car. ''By 2010, it became clear that the strategy wasn't right,'' Mr. Scaringe said. ''Tesla had launched its Roadster, and the world didn't need another company doing that. We shelved everything and started thinking about how to go forward.''  Amazon intends for this electric fleet, designed with feedback from drivers, to cut its annual carbon emissions by four million metric tons by 2030.  UPS, which has 125,000 vehicles on the road globally, is also committed to electrifying its trucks, with multiple partners. The company's largest order, for 10,000 vehicles, is to Arrival, a British company in which it has a minority stake. According to Scott Phillippi, senior director of maintenance and engineering for UPS's international operations, 70 percent of those trucks will be deployed in the United States, and they'll also be used across Europe.  Electric delivery, Mr. Phillippi said, ''gives us a chance to be transformational, not just in energy consumption but in terms of leveraging all the technology beyond just making the wheels turn that is available to fully connected vehicles.'' These include driving and braking by wire, over-the-air software upgrades and safety technology that will reduce accidents.  Mr. Phillippi said the biggest challenge is actually getting the eagerly anticipated electric trucks, which are just starting to trickle out of the manufacturers.  ''We want something that we can purchase that makes sense and is available,'' he said. ''Right now we're just starting to see the sweat on the ice cubes.'' The first Arrival trucks will be delivered next year, then, he hopes, ramp up in 2022 and 2023.  The Corporate Electric Vehicle Alliance, led by the Massachusetts-based corporate sustainability nonprofit Ceres, is pushing for more commitments, but the marketplace has to deliver. Sara Forni, senior manager for clean vehicles at Ceres, said: ''Companies are taking serious action to make this a reality, but there is a lack of commercially available vehicles to meet their diverse needs. It's a real gap.'' It helps that Ford will field an all-electric Transit cargo van for the 2022 model year.  Meanwhile, segments generally thought immune to electric power, because of range considerations, are starting to evolve. In late 2017, UPS ordered 125 Tesla heavy-duty Class 8 electric semi-trucks, for longer-distance deliveries.  ''Those will definitely be disruptive,'' Mr. Phillippi said. ''Covid has pushed out the delivery of these trucks, but we're likely to see them next year.'' A fleet that includes up-to-500-mile-range semis and 150-mile local delivery trucks ''will do a lot of what we need,'' he said.  FedEx is collaborating with Chanje, which is deploying a Chinese-made truck. In 2018, FedEx said it would add 1,000 of Chanje's V8100 electric vehicles to its fleet, 100 of them through direct purchase and 900 leased through Ryder. The timetable to deliver the first trucks this year has been set back, but the overall plan is still intact.  Bryan Hansel, chief executive of Chanje, said: ''2020 was a difficult year for everyone, but it put a spotlight on our industry. We expect to produce more than 5,000 vehicles in 2021, with our anchor customer, FedEx, getting the largest percentage of them. We think this number will start to move the needle and give our customers, who are desperately in need of supply, access to real-life units.''  Chanje will also supply charging infrastructure, including 42 stations at FedEx locations in California.  In a statement, FedEx, which operates more than 100,000 trucks in its express division globally, said it added almost 400 electric vehicles to its international fleet in the 2019 fiscal year. The international electric fleet then totaled 2,944, including forklifts and airport ground service equipment. Each new Chanje van would avoid 20 tons of emissions each year compared with its regular package vans, the company said.  Electric vans make sense for a variety of reasons, Mr. Hansel said, including reducing the cost per mile for deliveries -- especially crucial when online retailers compete by offering free deliveries. ''The last mile for deliveries used to be overnight envelopes, but now it's dog food,'' he said. The same-day delivery market will account for $200 billion in U.S. online sales by 2025, according to Accenture.  An Ohio company, Workhorse, is hoping to deliver 300 to 400 delivery vans this year, and UPS is an eager customer. But the big prize is what the U.S. Postal Service calls Next Generation Delivery Vehicles, which has been in a bidding process going back five years.  Suppliers provided test vehicles, which have electric, hybrid and internal-combustion drivetrains, and testing of those was completed in early 2019. The post office has been struggling financially, but it wants as many as 186,000 of these vehicles to be delivered at a cost of more than $6 billion to replace its aging fleet. Workhorse is a finalist, and the post office plans to make awards for the production phase by the end of 2020.  Some of the companies pushing for change don't actually own their own fleets, but direct their supply chains. The Swedish giant Ikea, which aims to be ''climate positive'' by 2030, announced two years ago that by 2025 all of its deliveries across 30 markets ''will use electric vehicles or other zero-emission solutions.''  ''Shanghai is up and running today with fully electric vehicles,'' said Steven Moelk, project implementation manager at Ikea. ''The other markets we've prioritized are Paris, Los Angeles, New York and Amsterdam.''  The company is close to meeting its goal in New York, he said, and Los Angeles ''will take a little longer.'' A big part of making these deliveries work is adding charging infrastructure to Ikea's stores, and that process is underway, Mr. Moelk said.  In 2018, McKinsey & Company said that electric delivery was emerging from the pilot stages to series production. That trend is much more apparent now, though the pandemic and other factors are still slowing down those production lines. But for manufacturers, the incentives are clear -- in the form of concrete orders from companies that want desperately to plug in.   ART 	 An electric UPS truck in London in 2018, top.

"Document NYTF000020200522eg5m00048","Business/Financial Desk; SECTB","Robots Will Need Humans in Future","By John Markoff","1196 words","22 May 2020","The New York Times","NYTF","Late Edition - Final","1",NA,"English","Copyright 2020 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.","The Tesla chief Elon Musk and other big-name Silicon Valley executives have long promised a car that can do all the driving without human assistance.  But Ben Shneiderman, a University of Maryland computer scientist who has for decades warned against blindly automating tasks with computers, thinks fully automated cars and the tech industry's vision for a robotic future is misguided. Even dangerous. Robots should collaborate with humans, he believes, rather than replace them.","Late last year, Dr. Shneiderman embarked on a crusade to convince the artificial intelligence world that it is heading in the wrong direction. In February, he confronted organizers of an industry conference on ''Assured Autonomy'' in Phoenix, telling them that even the title of their conference was wrong. Instead of trying to create autonomous robots, he said, designers should focus on a new mantra, designing computerized machines that are ''reliable, safe and trustworthy.''  There should be the equivalent of a flight data recorder for every robot, Dr. Shneiderman argued.  It is a warning that's likely to gain more urgency when the world's economies eventually emerge from the devastation of the coronavirus pandemic and millions who have lost their jobs try to return to work. A growing number of them will find they are competing with or working side by side with machines.  Dr. Shneiderman, 72, began spreading his message decades ago. A pioneer in the field human-computer interaction, he co-founded in 1982 what is now the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems and coined the term ''direct manipulation'' to describe the way objects are moved on a computer screen either with a mouse or, more recently, with a finger.  In 1997, Dr. Shneiderman engaged in a prescient debate with Pattie Maes, a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Lab, over the then-fashionable idea of intelligent software agents designed to perform autonomous tasks for computer users -- anything from reordering groceries to making a restaurant reservation.  ''Designers believe they are creating something lifelike and smart -- however, users feel anxious and unable to control these systems,'' he argued.  Since then, Dr. Shneiderman has argued that designers run the risk not just of creating unsafe machines but of absolving humans of ethical responsibility of the actions taken by autonomous systems, ranging from cars to weapons.  The conflict between human and computer control is at least as old as interactive computing itself.  The distinction first appeared in two computer science laboratories that were created in 1962 near Stanford University. John McCarthy, a computer scientist who had coined the term ''artificial intelligence,'' established the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory with the goal of creating a ''thinking machine'' in a decade. And Douglas Engelbart, who invented the computer mouse, created the Augmentation Research Center at the Stanford Research Center and coined the term ''intelligence augmentation,'' or I.A.  In recent years, the computer industry and academic researchers have tried to bring the two fields back together, describing the resulting discipline as ''humanistic'' or ''human-centered'' artificial intelligence.  Dr. Shneiderman has challenged the engineering community to rethink the way it approaches artificial intelligence-based automation. Until now, machine autonomy has been described as a one-dimensional scale ranging from machines that are manually controlled to systems that run without human intervention.  The best known of these one-dimensional models is a set of definitions related to self-driving vehicles established by the Society of Automotive Engineers. It describes six levels of vehicle autonomy ranging from Level 0, requiring complete human control, to Level 5, which is full driving automation.  In contrast, Dr. Shneiderman has sketched out a two-dimensional alternative that allows for both high levels of machine automation and human control. With certain exceptions such as automobile airbags and nuclear power plant control rods, he asserts that the goal of computing designers should be systems in which computing is used to extend the abilities of human users.  This approach has already been popularized by both roboticists and Pentagon officials. Gill Pratt, the head of the Toyota Research Institute, is a longtime advocate of keeping humans ''in the loop.'' His institute has been working to develop Guardian, a system that the researchers have described as ''super advanced driver assistance.''  ''There is so much that automation can do to help people that is not about replacing them,'' Dr. Pratt said. He has focused the laboratory not just on car safety but also on the challenge of developing robotic technology designed to support older drivers as well.  Similarly, Robert O. Work, a deputy secretary of defense under Presidents Trump and Barack Obama, backed the idea of so-called centaur weapons systems, which would require human control, instead of A.I.-based robot killers, now called lethal autonomous weapons.  The term ''centaur'' was originally popularized in the chess world, where partnerships of humans and computer programs consistently defeated unassisted software.  At the Phoenix conference on autonomous systems this year, Dr. Shneiderman said Boeing's MCAS flight-control system, which was blamed after two 737 Max jets crashed, was an extreme example of high automation and low human control.  ''The designers believed that their autonomous system could not fail,'' he wrote in an unpublished article that has been widely circulated. ''Therefore, its existence was not described in the user manual and the pilots were not trained in how to switch to manual override.''  Dr. Shneiderman said in an interview that he had attended the conference with the intent of persuading the organizers to change its name from a focus on autonomy to a focus on human control.  ''I've come to see that names and metaphors are very important,'' he said.  He also cited examples where the Air Force, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Defense Science Board, a committee of civilian experts that advises the Defense Department on science and technology, had backed away from a reliance on autonomous systems.  Robin Murphy, a computer scientist and robotics specialist at Texas A&M University, said she had spoken to Dr. Shneiderman and broadly agreed with his argument.  ''I think there's some imperfections, and I have talked to Ben about this, but I don't know anything better,'' she said. ''We've got to think of ways to better represent how humans and computers are engaged together.''  There are also skeptics.  ''Ben's notion that his two-dimensional model is a fresh perspective simply is not true,'' said Missy Cummings, director of Duke University's Humans and Autonomy Laboratory, who said she relied on his human-interface ideas in her design classes.  ''The degree of collaboration should be driven by the amount of uncertainty in the system and the criticality of outcomes,'' she said. ''Nuclear reactors are highly automated for a reason: Humans often do not have fast enough reaction times to push the rods in if the reactor goes critical.''

Gurbir S. Grewal, New Jersey's attorney general, on Friday told the state's 21 county prosecutors that police officers should stop using the Clearview AI app, an order first reported by NJ.com.  The New York Times reported last week that Clearview had amassed a database of over three billion photos across the web. The vast database powers an app that can match people to their online photos and link back to the sites the images came from.  ''Until this week, I had not heard of Clearview AI,'' Mr. Grewal said. ''I was troubled. The reporting raised questions about data privacy, about cybersecurity, about law enforcement security, about the integrity of our investigations.''  In a promotional video posted to its website this week, Clearview included images of Mr. Grewal because the company said its app had played a role last year in Operation Open Door, a New Jersey police sting that led to the arrest of 19 people accused of being child predators.  Mr. Grewal's office sent Clearview a cease-and-desist letter that asked the company to stop using the office and its investigations to promote its products.  ''We've received the attorney general's letter and are complying,'' said Tor Ekeland, Clearview's lawyer. ''The video has been removed.'' KASHMIR HILL  RETAIL  Papyrus to Close Stores, but the Brand Remains  The latest victim of the retail apocalypse? Birthday cards.  Papyrus, the greeting card and stationery chain, will close all its stores in the United States and Canada after its parent company filed for bankruptcy.  Schurman Fine Papers, which operates 254 stores, including the Papyrus brand as well as the American Greetings and Carlton Card chains, filed for bankruptcy protection on Thursday. All three store chains will close, but the branded cards they sell will still be available at other retailers.  In its filing, Schurman Fine Papers said business had declined as part of ''the general downturn in the brick-and-mortar retail industry.'' But the store closings are not the end of the Papyrus brand.  While Schurman Fine Papers operates the Papyrus stores, the brand itself is owned by American Greetings, which supplies Papyrus products to more than 300 retailers, according to a spokeswoman for American Greetings, Patrice Molnar. DAVID YAFFE-BELLANY  AUTOMOBILES  U.S. Senator Urges Tesla to Rename Safety System  A United States senator on Friday urged Tesla to rebrand its driver assistance system, saying it has ''an inherently misleading name'' and is subject to potentially dangerous misuse.  But the electric automaker said in a letter that it had taken steps to ensure driver engagement with Autopilot and enhance its safety features. Tesla introduced new warnings for red lights and stop signs last year ''to minimize the potential risk of red light- or stop sign-running as a result of temporary driver inattention,'' the company said in the letter  Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts called for ''rebranding and remarketing the system to reduce misuse, as well as building backup driver monitoring tools that will make sure no one falls asleep at the wheel.''  Autopilot has been engaged in at least three Tesla vehicles involved in fatal crashes in the United States since 2016.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved.","In what Northern California first responders are calling a miracle, four people survived an incredible single-vehicle crash after a Tesla dove off a cliff along the Pacific Coast Highway Monday morning.  A 4-year-old girl, a 9-year-old boy and two adults suffered serious injuries after the sedan they were riding in plunged hundreds of feet off a cliff along State Route 1 near Devil's Slide – an area known for fatal wrecks, officials with Coastside Fire Protection District/Cal Fire reported.","The vehicle apparently flipped a few times before landing on its wheels, wedged against the cliff just feet from the surf, Brian Pottenger, a battalion chief with the agency, said at the scene.  On Monday afternoon, Cal Fire San Mateo's Santa Cruz Unit shared a video letting drivers in the area know that the car went over the cliff and there would be delays along the coastal roadway.  The victims were initially listed in critical condition but all four were conscious and alert when rescuers arrived.  The Tesla plummeted more than 250 feet from the highway and crashed into a rocky outcropping, officials said. Pottenger said the vehicle flipped several times before landing on its wheels, wedged against the cliff just feet from the surf.  Neither CAL Fire nor the California Highway Patrol could immediately be reached for comment by USA TODAY Tuesday morning for an update on the victims' conditions.  Officials did not provide the victims' names or say where they are from.  Crashes along Devil's Slide, a steep, rocky and winding coastal area about 20 miles south of San Francisco between Pacifica and Montara, rarely end with survivors.  ""We go there all the time for cars over the cliff and they never live. This was an absolute miracle,"" Pottenger said.  Watching through binoculars  Pottenger said witnesses called 911 at 10:15 a.m. and responding crews set up a rope system from the highway to lower firefighters down the cliff.  At the same time, he said, other firefighters watching the sedan through binoculars noticed movement – a sign that at least one person was still alive.  ""Every one of us was shocked when we saw movement out of the front windshield,"" Pottenger said.  The incident turned from what had been likely a recovery of bodies to a rescue operation that took several hours amid constant rain, heavy winds, slick roads and crashing waves. The doors were smashed against the cliff and jammed shut, so firefighters were forced to cut the victims out of the car using the so-called ""jaws of life"" tools.  Crews pulled the two children out of the Tesla's back window and brought them up the cliff in a basket using a rope. They were rushed to the hospital by ambulance to be treated for musculoskeletal injuries, officials reported.  Based on the California Highway Patrol's initial investigation, troopers do not believe the Tesla was operating in Autopilot or Full Self-Driving mode at the time, Officer Mark Andrews said.  The road's conditions also were not believed to be a factor in the crash. There was no guardrail at the spot where the sedan went off the cliff.  ""The car traveled off the main portion of the roadway. For what reason, we don't know,"" Andrews said.

All Rights Reserved.","U.S. auto safety regulators launched an investigation into Tesla's partially self-driving car system after nearly a dozen reports of the company's vehicles crashing into cars at the scenes of incidents involving emergency responders.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened the probe Friday into Tesla's Autopilot, which steers, brakes and accelerates the vehicle on most roads with lanes.","Though the system can drive the vehicle on its own in many circumstances, drivers are supposed to keep their hands on the wheel in case they need to take over when Autopilot encounters a situation that's too complex for it to handle on its own.  The National Transportation Safety Board and NHTSA have investigated Autopilot multiple times, including after a crash in 2016 that killed a man in Florida who authorities said had too much confidence in the system's capabilities. Safety watchdogs have criticized Tesla for exaggerating Autopilot's functions, but Tesla CEO Elon Musk argued that the system is safer than human drivers.  In May, a deadly crash in Texas involving an Autopilot vehicle called attention to the fact that drivers can trick Autopilot into thinking someone's behind the wheel even if no one is.  Tesla owners have posted photos to YouTube showing themselves abusing the technology by riding in the back seat while the vehicle drives itself.  Soon after the Texas incident, Tesla announced it was activating cameras to monitor whether drivers are paying attention to the road while using Autopilot.  In the newest probe, NHTSA investigators identified 11 crashes since January 2018 ""in which Tesla models of various configurations have encountered first responder scenes and subsequently struck one or more vehicles involved with those scenes,"" according to an Office of Defects Investigation document. ""Most incidents took place after dark and the crash scenes encountered included scene control measures such as first responder vehicle lights, flares, an illuminated arrow board, and road cones. The involved subject vehicles were all confirmed to have been engaged in either Autopilot or Traffic Aware Cruise Control during the approach to the crashes.""  Tesla did not respond to a request seeking comment. The company eliminated its media relations department in the past year.

The updates to the Full Self-Driving beta version 9 became available Saturday according to tech publication The Verge, and Electrek, a news site dedicated to reports about Tesla and other electric vehicles.","The update expands assisted driving capabilities for a small pool of Tesla owners who get to try out features early, according to Electrek.  Tesla's assisted driving programs have come under scrutiny in the wake of several accidents involving Teslas, including some that were in Autopilot mode.  Since those incidents, federal transportation officials have said Tesla has done an inadequate job of monitoring drivers to make sure they are engaged and also has permitted the Autopilot feature to be used on roads where it's not suitable.  The car maker appeared to address some of those concerns in notes connected to the release of the software update, warning drivers to use the Full Self-Driving feature ""only if you will pay constant attention to the road and be prepared to act immediately, especially around blind corners, crossing intersections and in narrow driving situations,"" according to Electrek.  Tesla also reportedly began activating the in-car camera in its vehicles in May to keep track of attentiveness when drivers use the partially self-driving technology.  The new software update has been touted for the past three years with Elon Musk, Tesla's founder, repeatedly saying it was on its way, reports say.   CO 	 teslmi : Tesla, Inc.

Then, you drive your rental car where you want and once you arrive, you exit the vehicle and it takes off on its own.  Later this year, Las Vegas will be the testing ground for a pilot program sending driverless EVs, driven by a remote pilot, to customers who order a car via a mobile app. When the car arrives, the driver gets in and drives to his destination. After the rental driver leaves, the remote driver directs the EV to its next location.","Autonomous and driverless car technology company Halo plans to make the service available initially in urban parts of the Las Vegas Valley. Remote drivers have a 360-degree video view – just as if they were in the car – and additional sensors eliminate blind spots. Video and data are sent via T-Mobile's 5G network, the provider and Halo announced Thursday.  ""You push a button and summon an electric car. It just comes to your doorstep,"" Anand Nandakumar, the founder and CEO of Halo, told USA TODAY. ""You hop in and you drive the car to your destination and once you are done, hop off and walk away and the car just disappears.""  5G behind driverless 'magic'  T-Mobile, which launched its consumer 5G network last year, also in 2020 co-founded the 5G Open Innovation Lab along with several other tech companies including Dell, Intel and Microsoft. Halo has been in stealth mode for two years.  Despite the potential benefits of 5G connectivity including faster data speeds on smartphones and a growing network of internet-connected devices, there's not many real-world examples of how 5G can change things. Halo's remote-piloted cars could change that.  ""So many industries are already being transformed today by 5G, and it's the startups and entrepreneurs – developers like Halo – that are making the magic happen,"" said T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert in a statement to USA TODAY. ""True, nationwide 5G is powering groundbreaking new products and services that will change nearly every facet of our world, connecting people and things at massive scale.""  Originally based in the San Francisco Bay Area, Halo began testing remote control of EVs in California in August 2020. In February, the company moved its testing to Las Vegas, where Halo is now headquartered.  In addition to remote drivers piloting the Kia Niro crossover SUVs from Halo's mission control, Halo equips the vehicles with an artificial intelligence-driven ""Advanced Safe Stop mechanism"" that automatically brings the cars to a full stop when there's a potential safety hazard, the company said.  Risks in self-driving car tests  The development of self-driving cars has been underway for more than four years with big tech names such as Amazon, Apple and Google's parent company Alphabet involved, along with Tesla, Ford, GM and other auto makers.  But there have been setbacks such as the April crash of a Tesla in the Houston area that killed two passengers. In that case, the National Transportation Safety Board said in a preliminary report the driver had been behind the wheel but came to no conclusions about the crash's cause. Tesla says on its website that drivers are supposed to keep their hands on the wheel at all times, ready to take over when the semi-autonomous system is not able to steer, accelerate or brake on its own.  Uber sold its self-driving division last year to Aurora, a startup headed by Chris Urmson, who had led Google's autonomous vehicle efforts. That came after a self-driving Uber vehicle, with a backup operator in the driver's seat, fatally hit a 49-year-old woman in Tempe, Arizona, in March 2018. (Uber invested $400 million in Aurora, which is backed by Amazon, and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi joined the startup's board.  Las Vegas has been a hotspot for the testing of self-driving vehicles with demonstrations held during the Consumer Electronics Show beginning in January 2017. Between May 2018 and February 2020 in Las Vegas, Lyft and autonomous tech company Aptiv delivered more than 100,000 robotaxi self-driving rides, with a human driver sitting in the driver's seat. Lyft sold its self-driving unit in April to Woven Planet Holdings for about $550 million.  Halo's program seeks to build trust in autonomous vehicles, as well as increase the use of electric cars, Nandakumar said. ""Consumers never get an opportunity to actually see an autonomous car deployed on public roads. They never get a chance to interact with it or take rides with it,"" he said.  Pricing has not been announced, but Halo rides will be ""highly affordable for everyone,"" the companies said.  Beyond that, Halo's service seeks to solve the problem of ""the last mile between your last transit stop and your workplace or your home,"" said John Saw, executive vice president of advanced and emerging tech at T-Mobile. ""It helps us show the world, hey, we are not just talking about it but we are showing what we can do with 5G.""

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved.","The perception that self-driving cars can really operate themselves without driver involvement is worrying automotive watchdogs, who say that some Americans have grown dangerously confident in the capabilities of semi-autonomous vehicles.  Their comments come as electric vehicle maker Tesla's so-called Autopilot system is under scrutiny once again following a crash that killed two passengers in the Houston area late Saturday.","""I would start by saying there are no self-driving cars despite what you may read about or what you've seen advertised,"" said Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing for Consumer Reports. ""And there's certainly nothing anywhere close to self-driving that is in production right now.""  Tesla has been the most common target of critics for marketing that its vehicles are capable of ""full self-driving"" with an upgrade. They are not capable of full self-driving – and, in fact, Tesla says on its website that drivers are supposed to keep their hands on the wheel at all times, ready to take over when the system is not able to steer, accelerate or brake on its own.  In general, the most advanced available technology in new cars from Tesla, General Motors and Mercedes-Benz is capable of steering, accelerating and braking in certain circumstances, but their ability remains limited and drivers are supposed to continuously pay attention to the road.  Some drivers have found ways around Autopilot's restrictions, including the use of ""Autopilot Buddy,"" a now-illegal aftermarket that tricked the vehicle into thinking the driver's hands were on the wheel. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued a cease-and-desist order to that device's manufacturer in June 2018.  It was not immediately clear whether Autopilot was engaged in the latest Tesla crash. But Harris County Precinct 4 Constable Mark Herman told The Wall Street Journal that investigators are ""99.9% sure"" that ""there was no one at the wheel"" when the crash happened.  ""Autopilot is an intentionally deceptive name being used for a set of features that are essentially an advanced cruise control system,"" said Jason Levine, director of the Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit Center for Auto Safety. ""There really is no longer a question that Tesla's marketing is leading consumers to foreseeably misuse the technology in a dangerous way.""  NHTSA said Monday that it is investigating the incident.  ""NHTSA has immediately launched a Special Crash Investigation team to investigate the crash,"" the agency said in a statement. ""We are actively engaged with local law enforcement and Tesla to learn more about the details of the crash and will take appropriate steps when we have more information.""  Tesla did not respond to an emailed request seeking comment for this story.  On Saturday, before news of the crash broke, CEO Elon Musk's Twitter account cited a report claiming that cars with its Autopilot system engaged ""are now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle.""  On Monday, after reports about the crash circulated, Musk said on Twitter that ""data logs recovered so far show Autopilot was not enabled & this car did not purchase FSD,"" referring to ""full self-driving"" capability. That could not be independently verified.  ""Moreover, standard Autopilot would require lane lines to turn on, which this street did not have,"" he said.  Tesla is among many tech companies and automakers that are developing self-driving cars, including Waymo, General Motors, Volkswagen and Ford. Apple is reportedly doing the same.  Automotive watchdogs acknowledge that the development of self-driving car technology will likely be reducing crashes and deaths on the road. More than 36,000 people were killed in the U.S. in crashes in 2019, according to NHTSA, which has endorsed the development of self-driving vehicles.  But self-driving cars currently under development are being tested in limited scenarios, such as fully mapped roads in Phoenix, San Francisco and Detroit.  ""Getting it right to the point where the driver doesn't need to be engaged is extremely challenging, and we're just not there yet,"" said Greg Brannon, director of automotive engineering for AAA.  Paradoxically, the better the system gets, the more misplaced faith drivers have in their capability, Brannon said.  Fisher of Consumer Reports said part of the problem is that Tesla's system ""can be engaged in areas where it is absolutely beyond its capability.""  In effect, that means Autopilot can be activated on roads that are too complicated for it to safely maneuver, he said.  Other automakers have taken a different approach with systems that partially automate driving in limited circumstances. GM has deployed a system called Super Cruise on Cadillac models, providing hands-free driving on fully mapped highways and freeways. The system uses a camera to track the driver's eye movement to ensure drivers are keeping their eyes on the road. If drivers take their eyes off the road for more than a few moments, the system alerts them to pay attention – and if they don't look at the road, it will bring the car to a stop.  ""There are systems that automate steering and automate speed that need constant monitoring from the driver,"" Fisher said. ""The driver is still driving the car even if some of the controls are automated.""  Even automakers that produce semi-autonomous cars offer what they call advanced driver assistance systems, including technology such as lane-keeping assistance, blind-spot monitoring and automatic emergency braking.  ""They're driver aids, and that's all,"" Fisher said. ""Assist is the keyword. If there are systems that assist the driver, that can absolutely be helpful. Give the driver more information, help the driver with certain tasks. Done correctly, they can absolutely improve safety and comfort for the driver.""  About 96% of 2020 model-year vehicles came with at least one advanced driver assistance systems feature, according to AAA.  Levine, of the Center for Auto Safety, said advanced driver assistance systems features ""could save far more lives, far more affordably and right away"" than systems like Tesla's Autopilot.  While some Americans appear to be too trusting of self-driving car technology, others don't trust it at all.  About 86% ""would be afraid to ride in a self-driving vehicle"" or ""are unsure about it,"" according to a recent AAA survey. Only 14% ""would trust riding in a vehicle that drives itself.""  In the short run, ""the real opportunity is to do a better job with basic safety systems that can really make a difference in reducing fatalities on the road,"" AAA's Brannon said.

Yet GM is expected to sell its own insurance policies to all vehicles, including non-GM cars, trucks and SUVs, as well as homeowners and renters insurance, through its new agency, OnStar Insurance Services.  The automaker said it eventually will tie auto insurance rates directly to the consenting driver's performance based on driving data wirelessly collected from the vehicle, rather than educational history and other personal factors.  OnStar Insurance President Andrew Rose declined to provide an estimate for how much the average driver might save since it's dependent on so many variables, including the kind of car they drive, their road habits and their location. But he said the savings will be ""significant.""  The average American is expected to pay about $1,463 for insurance in 2020, according to policy comparison site Insurify.  ""You'll have the opportunity over time to have greater control over your pricing,"" Rose said. ""We know your vehicle better than anybody else and, if you consent, we will use your information on how you drive your vehicle to demonstrate that you're a better driver and thus lower your"" prices.  It could be hard to get Americans to switch. About 2 in 3 consumers don't shop around for a better deal when their policy is up for renewal, according to a survey by LendingTree. The older you get, the less likely you are to switch.  But the chance to save money could be a significant lure, especially during these tough economic times, said Andrew Hurst, who analyzes insurance trends for LendingTree.  ""Most people fancy themselves as pretty good drivers, so they're intrigued by the notion that they'll be rewarded for that,"" Hurst said.  To be sure, most major insurers and various upstarts already offer some form of policy that considers the policy holder's driving habits. But those policies typically require the driver to consent to providing that data through an onboard device.  ""They're able to track how you're driving, when you're driving, where you're driving,"" said Kyle Schmitt, vice president and global managing director of J.D. Power's insurance industry division. ""Are you braking hard? Are you using your phone while you're driving? They can now at least rudimentarily and, in many cases, quite sophisticatedly measure these types of things.""  Good drivers get lower rates. Bad drivers? Expect more conventional premiums.  ""If you behave poorly, you pretty much know where the ceiling is,"" Schmitt said.  Privacy concerns  A majority of drivers haven't yet opted in, according to industry experts. Many have been wary of handing over their data without getting something concrete in return.  ""For them to start making that trade-off, they need to start seeing some pretty substantial discounts,"" Schmitt said.  Rose said that the benefits of providing access to vehicle driving data will extend beyond savings. In the future, he said, GM will introduce technology that enables its vehicles to notify emergency responders and OnStar Insurance when an accident occurs so that the insurance claims process and repairs can begin quickly.  OnStar Insurance will be sold primarily through a website, though it will have call centers. Rose said GM would not place insurance agents in dealerships, though he said dealers could help car buyers obtain policies online.  Self-driving cars change game  The move to start an insurance agency harkens back to the days when GM was a sprawling company with wide-ranging products and services. The automaker sold insurance through its GMAC unit for several decades before running into financial troubles and selling off the division in 2008. GMAC rebranded as Ally.  More car companies will be attracted by the possibility of gaining additional revenue from insurance, but the ""biggest value"" is a ""deeper relationship with their customers,"" Insurify CEO Snejina Zacharia said.  ""People want to feel empowered that they're making the best decision for themselves,"" she said.  One X factor in the insurance business is the emergence of autonomous vehicle technology, including systems, like Tesla's Autopilot and GM's Super Cruise, that partially drive the vehicle on behalf of the motorist.  As self-driving car technology becomes a reality in years to come, some insurance industry experts believe that rates will fall sharply because there will be fewer crashes. That may mean less profit for insurers.  But Rose said ""there's going to be a need for auto insurance for a significant period of time,"" and when autonomous vehicles become a reality, ""you're still going to have tree branches that fall on cars.""  Launching an insurance business from scratch takes an investment in actuarial science, advertising and regulatory teams that can navigate the different insurance laws in the 50 states.  One advantage for automakers is that they are already spending heavily on advertising and could potentially begin appending their marketing with information on their insurance plans.  ""They have deep pockets,"" Schmitt said.

"Document USAT000020201030egau0000x","MONEY","Thermal cameras could help cars see well at night","Eric D Lawrence","1046 words","30 October 2020","USA Today","USAT",NA,"B.3","ISSN:07347456","English","© 2020 USA Today. Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved.","No one was crossing Kercheval Avenue on The Hill in Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan, as a minivan made its way through the shopping district one evening this fall, but people were clearly nearby.  They could be seen there on the laptop screen from inside the vehicle, their presence confirmed by glowing images captured by a thermal camera.","But the pedestrians weren't on the street, and it took a moment to realize that they were actually on the sidewalk, obscured by decorative plantings and the darkness that coated everything not illuminated.  It wasn't a great night for spotting pedestrians on this particular weeknight on a drive through a couple of the Grosse Pointes and the east side of Detroit. Maybe the pandemic was keeping people inside. Those who were out, however, were not hard to see, at least on the screen.  The eyeball view through the windshield was a different story, with darkness providing an effective camouflage. And darkness can be deadly for pedestrians.  Most pedestrians who die in crashes are killed at night, but nighttime has been when the technology designed to prevent pedestrian crashes struggles most.  Last year, AAA revealed some startling deficiencies in driver assistance systems designed to protect pedestrians.  At night, several test vehicles equipped with automatic emergency braking systems and pedestrian detection were found to be ""completely ineffective."" Rather than bash the automakers' efforts, AAA encouraged continued development of systems because of the scope of the pedestrian death crisis in this country.  But finding a solution as the deaths of so many Americans on and along our roads has continued to rise – 6,283 men, women and children in 2018 alone, according to federal statistics – has become more urgent. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration even designated October as the first national Pedestrian Safety Month, an acknowledgment of the dangers faced by vulnerable road users. A 2018 Detroit Free Press/USA TODAY investigation highlighted the role the increase in large vehicles, such as SUVs, has played in the rising number of deaths.  Vehicle technology is one way to improve protection for pedestrians at night, and a couple of thermal imaging companies are promoting their systems as the answer. Thermal imaging already is having a bit of a moment this year in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thermal cameras can be used to detect elevated body temperatures at a distance. That allows them to function as an initial screening in such places as auto plants to monitor for people who could be feverish, a potential symptom of the virus.  Results of thermal testing in Michigan appear to show promise in the realm of pedestrian detection at night, too.  U.S.-based Flir Systems, along with VSI Labs, tested an automatic emergency braking system at the American Center for Mobility in Ypsilanti Township. The tests ""fused"" data from thermal sensing with radar, a nonthermal camera and a computer network. The test vehicle, a Ford Fusion equipped with Flir's system, managed to avoid heated targets designed to appear as a child or an adult in all but two tries out of more than two dozen. In the two cases where the car touched the targets, it did not knock them down.  In contrast, four other test vehicles not equipped with Flir's technology – a BMW X7, Subaru Forrester, Toyota Corolla and Tesla Model 3 – all failed in night testing by hitting the targets. They performed much better during daylight testing although only the X7 managed to get through each of those tests without hitting the target, according to Flir.  ""We were able to stop really successfully at night,"" explained Mike Walters, a Flir vice president.  He described the instances where the Flir-equipped Fusion made contact with the targets as a minor touch rather than a full hit, something that can be fixed with adjustments to the system in future testing.  That would be a far cry from what was seen in videos shown as part of AAA's testing, with a 2019 Chevrolet Malibu, Honda Accord, Tesla Model 3 and Toyota Camry plowing into targets in many cases.  Thermal cameras have been pitched as a way to help advanced driver assistance systems and someday actual self-driving systems ""see"" pedestrians and even deer on the roads. But it's the focus on nighttime applications, which is what Flir and Adasky, a competitor from Israel, are discussing. With three-quarters of fatal pedestrian deaths happening in nighttime crashes, systems that work well only during daylight hours would appear to have limited appeal.  The recent nighttime drive around Detroit's east side and the Grosse Pointes in a minivan equipped with Adasky's thermal camera showed the technology at work. The setup was not designed to brake for anyone crossing the road but instead to show via a laptop display what the camera can pick up. A reporter, who had been on a previous drive in daylight, could see clearly on the screen when people, even in dark clothing on a dark street, were nearby. In several cases, pedestrians and cyclists were very difficult to see with the naked eye, but their heat signature was visible on the screen. A couple of instances showed a slight delay in the image appearing, but the man behind the wheel, Bill Grabowski, head of Adasky, North America, said the system can be adjusted to account for that as well.  Most experts promote the idea of using several different types of sensors for automatic emergency braking systems. Thermal cameras can detect people and animals in conditions, such as at night and in the rain, that might be a challenge for other types of sensors.  ""It's going to fill the gap in the edge cases that all these other sensors can't hit,"" Grabowski said of cameras.  David Zuby, chief research officer at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, said thermal technology appears to offer promise, but his Virginia-based group has not yet been able to do a comparison.  However, Zuby said automakers will need to address nighttime driving conditions.  ""The infrared technology might be a good technology for achieving that,"" he said, noting that other combinations and better headlights could work.

"Document USAT000020200929eg9t0001f","MONEY","Technology could drive your choice of a new car","Marc Saltzman","944 words","29 September 2020","USA Today","USAT",NA,"B.4","ISSN:07347456","English","© 2020 USA Today. Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved.","What do automotive shoppers really want?  A few years ago, those who kicked the tires on new vehicles might have prioritized fuel efficiency, comfort or horsepower.","Today, it's all about the tech.  ""The race never ends to develop 'must have' vehicle technologies,"" says Kristin Kolodge, executive director of driver interaction and human machine interface research at J.D. Power. ""New technology continues to be a primary factor in the vehicle purchase decision.""  Automotive expert Nik Miles echoes Kolodge's assessment: ""Besides price, tech plays a major role when considering a new car – interestingly, for every age group – but it has to be easy to use.""  Miles is founder and host of OurAutoExpert.com. ""Even inexpensive vehicles are loaded with tech, whether it's tech you see, such as cutting-edge infotainment systems, or tech you don't see that keeps drivers safe,"" Miles says.  The following is a quick look at a few promising teched-out vehicles this fall.  2021 Toyota Venza  Starting at $32,470, this new two-row crossover SUV features Toyota Safety Sense 2.5, a comprehensive suite of active safety systems that includes a pre-collision system with advanced pedestrian and bicyclist detection; road sign assist, which actively scans the sides of the road to detect select road signs and displays them on the dashboard; and emergency steering assist, which could help drivers avoid a pedestrian or other object.  The 2021 Toyota Venza features lane departure alert, lane tracing assist and dynamic cruise control.  In a first for the company, the vehicle supports an optional Star Gaze fixed panoramic moonroof. Similar to some airplanes that use this technology to block outside light, this is electrochromic glass that allows drivers to switch from transparent to frosted modes with the push of a button. This is a $1,400 option on the LTD grade of the vehicle (which includes a 12.3-inch touchscreen).  Ford Mustang Mach-E  Speaking of firsts, Ford is expanding its Mustang lineup for the first time in 55 years, with an all-electric model.  The Mach-E (from $44,995) is a four-door SUV that has similar hallmarks to the company's iconic muscle car – in its design and performance – and can go from 0 to 60 in about three and a half seconds for the GT Performance Edition package (about $60,000).  Aside from a ton of power and torque, this electric vehicle (EV) crossover has an estimated range of at least 300 miles, with the available extended-range battery and rear-wheel drive. It can route customers to nearby public charging stations and will provide access to more than 12,500 public charge stations in the FordPass network.  2021 Cadillac Escalade  When it comes to semiautonomous driving aids, the 2021 Cadillac Escalade (from $77,490) features an enhanced Super Cruise system, which includes ""lane change on-demand,"" allowing drivers to direct the system to perform a single lane change using the turn signal to indicate the desired direction of the move.  Speaking of lanes, an enhancement to ""dynamic lane offset"" means the Escalade can be nudged slightly into its lane when other vehicles pass closely.  When activated on supported freeways and highways, Super Cruise uses lidar-generated maps, high-precision GPS, cameras and radar sensors to monitor the road, as well as a system to ensure the driver is paying attention. Unlike Tesla's Autopilot, Cadillac's Super Cruise on the 2021 Escalade (or CT6 sedan) does not require motorists' hands on the wheel, but their eyes must remain fixed on the road ahead.  Along with augmented reality (AR)-enabled navigation – which uses live street views to enhance driving directions – the Escalade has an industry-first curved OLED display, which is as thin as a sheet of paper. In total, there are more than 38 inches of screen tech, with twice the pixel density of a 4K television.  Out this fall, the OLED display and AR Navigation come standard with the 2021 Escalade, while the Super Cruise feature costs about $2,500, available on the Premium Luxury, Sports and Platinum trims.  Other tech  Dashboard cameras (""dashcams"") give you peace of mind in case of an incident on the road (or interaction with authorities). The Sylvania Roadsight dash camera line offers a wide-angle HD camera system that loops video recordings of road interactions and automatically saves footage in the event of a detected accident (G-sensor technology). Unlike many other dashcams, the camera connects via its dedicated Wi-Fi to the SYLVANIA Connect mobile app (iOS and Android), which allows drivers to view a live-feed of the camera, adjust settings and download and share footage. Prices start at $59 for the Sylvania Roadsight Rear and up to $149 for the Roadsight Pro model.  Though you may have Siri or Google Assistant to talk to behind the wheel – via Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, respectively – if you prefer Alexa, there's an inexpensive way to add ""her"" to any vehicle. Called Amazon's Echo Auto ($49), this device connects to the Alexa app on your phone and plays through your car's speakers, through wireless Bluetooth or an available aux-in port. Echo Auto features eight microphones and far-field technology, so it can clearly hear you over music, air conditioning, and outside road noise. Along with using your voice to check the news, weather, manage your calendar or make calls, you can also stream content from Audible (audiobooks), Spotify (music and podcasts), Amazon Music, Apple Music, SiriusXM, and radio stations with TuneIn and iHeartRadio. An air vent mount is included.

Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All Rights Reserved.","The fully self-driving car is about to take a step closer to reality.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Tuesday that the test version of the company's Autopilot system will be released in ""a month or so."" While he didn't describe its capabilities, Musk said that once it's out, ""you'll see what it's like. It's amazing. It's clearly going to work.""","A number of startups and established automakers have been racing to develop self-driving technology. While it has been fielded in tests, a system that completely drives the car in all circumstances without driver input is yet to become a feature on popular cars. Tesla's current system requires drivers to always pay attention behind the wheel and, frankly, it's not clear how far Tesla's next step will go.  Musk spoke at the company's annual stockholders meeting, a drive-in theater-style event before a sea of Tesla owners in their cars, done in the name of social distancing. They honked in unison whenever Musk announced promising developments.  Musk had said that the company's latest electric cars have all the hardware they need for self driving. All they were missing was the software.  To accomplish the next step, Musk said his team has to completely rewrite the Autopilot software. He has been testing the cutting-edge versions himself.  While a self-driving car would certainly be convenient, Musk added that safety could be the greatest benefit. Musk said he was confident that an advanced Autopilot would allow Teslas to become 10 times less likely to be involved in a serious crash than the industry average.  ""That's a lot of lives saved and a lot of injuries avoided,"" Musk said.  Tesla has seen its fortunes zoom financially this year. By mid-August, its valuation already was three times the value of Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler combined. It did it by creating vehicles that captured the hearts of customers with their plug-in electric drivetrains and the promise of self-driving.  In keeping with their emotional spirit, Tesla created the Models S, X, Y and Model 3 that together spell SEXY – if you flip the 3 backward.  But the company's plans going forward, as outlined to investors, are decidedly unsexy by comparison. Musk said he expects all automakers to eventually offer their own electric and self-driving vehicles, so Tesla will stand apart by becoming the low-cost producer. He said he plans to wring so many cost savings from pioneering manufacturing techniques and battery innovations that the company will be able to offer a true low-priced, self-driving electric model.  ""I think probably about three years from now we are confident we can make a very compelling $25,000 electric vehicle that's also fully autonomous,"" Musk said to a round of approving honks.  Besides the four sedans and SUVs, the company plans to sell electric semitrucks and a radical, angular electric pickup truck. Musk said about 500,000 people have preordered the Cybertruck, Tesla's name for the pickup.  Asked about the future of today's gasoline-powered cars, Musk said he thinks their makers are doomed in the long run. All vehicles, he predicted, run more efficiently on electricity except rockets.  Piston-powered cars will become a curiosity, he said, noting that there are ""some steam engines somewhere.""   CO 	 teslmi : Tesla, Inc.

Imagine a time when daily commutes times are cut in half, or when you don't have to own or operate a car at all to get to your destination.","Those types of transportation options are projected to be available by the year 2030 thanks to improvements in electric battery power, internet connectivity and next-level automation.  ""Transportation planning has always been around how to get a vehicle from place to place using roads and traffic lights. But that's changing,"" said Thom Rickert, a risk and insurance specialist at Trident Public Risk Solutions.  The mobility industry's next objective is to focus on moving a person through multiple modes of connected travel.  That's where air taxis, e-scooters, connected trains and semiautonomous cars come into play, powered by widespread 5G connectivity, Rickert said.  Interstate travel  In the coming years, rural pockets of the central U.S. could become better connected to such big cities as Atlanta and Dallas in a effort to reduce overall travel times.  Hyperloop is a transportation method that aims to eliminate the barriers of distance and time over the next few years if regulation and test run estimates go according to plan.  The American company is building out a series of ""passenger capsules"" that can zip through tubes while carrying up to 40 people at a time.  Imagine standing in a futuristic pod that floats inside a vacuum as gradual electric propulsion shoots the vessel to its destination, hundreds of miles away, in mere minutes. Think of it as a mix between a bullet train and an autonomous vehicle inside a long tube.  ""You're going to see a huge boom from the middle of the country if Hyperloop takes off in those places,"" said Ryan Kelly, head of marketing and communications at Hyperloop. The company is building pilot tubes in Dubai and working with states in the U.S. to get the project off the ground.  ""The first thing you'll see is safety certification by 2024,"" Kelly said. Then 6-mile tracks will be built throughout parts of middle America.  In an age when people want to connect to transportation in lightning speed, traffic congestion, population growth and an expanding job market have led to an increase in commute times across the country's metro areas, transportation authorities say.  Average commute times across the country edged up from 25 minutes in 2009 to more than 27 minutes in 2019, according to the Census Bureau.  But in metro areas, the average one-way commute can be as long as 43 minutes, according to a study by Best Mattress Brand, a company that researches the causes of sleep issues that affect driving abilities. Big cities tend to have more people and greater congestion traffic.  Aviation  Shorter distance or ""last-mile"" travel will be revolutionized through the widespread adoption of 5G connectivity which will allow machines to communicate with each other directly, enabling more cars and other means of transportation to travel at faster speeds without humans operating them.  Current wireless networks, for example, haven't been strong enough to send reliable signals to aircraft throughout a flight, according to Laurie Garrow, associate director for the Center for Urban and Regional Air Mobility at Georgia Tech.  Toward the end of the decade, ""5G connectivity will allow us to design air taxis and give us the ability to think about truly moving toward autonomous control of aircraft,"" Garrow said.  She projects electric take-off and landing aircraft displacing some of the helicopters in operation today. ""And we will see new markets open up with these aircraft,"" Garrow said.  Though such hurdles as safety regulations, noise concerns and infrastructure needs could prolong projected launch dates, Uber and Hyundai plan on lifting air taxis into the skies in the next few years. Other electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicle companies have similar plans.  Electric travel  As engineering costs fall and battery power continues to improve, the electric vehicles market will continue to grow, though EVs aren't expected to overtake gas-powered cars anytime soon, according to Joe Wiesenfelder, the executive editor at Cars.com.  ""Overall (EV) use in the country will continue to lag due to consistently low gas prices, lack of public infrastructure, the recent EPA/California ruling and pending trade wars,"" Wiesenfelder said in a statement.  In 2019, EVs represented about 1% of the cars on the road in the U.S. Auto industry analyst Eric Lyman told USA TODAY he projects EVs could make up 5% of car sales by 2025.  Car ownership  As EVs gain traction, an increase in such transportation alternatives as air taxis could lead to a gradual decline in car ownership within the next five years, Rickert said.  ""As all these different solutions are tested, perfected, adjusted and evolved, there will be less of a dependence on an automobile"" and less traffic on the ground, Rickert, an insurance specialist, said. ""Especially in urban areas.""  Over-the-air updates  Everyday vehicles that are capable of receiving over-the-air updates from automakers will become ubiquitous as drivers want their cars to be just as updatable as smartphones.  ""You don't want to hear that your vehicle that lasts an average 11 years is out of date,"" Wiesenfelder said.  Much like smartphones, older connected cars can get some of the same features as new cars thanks to regular airwave updates. Tesla kickstarted the trend and OTA updates have begun to spread throughout the auto industry as companies including Ford, BMW and GM roll out updatable vehicle platforms.  Autonomous driving  Experts say self-driving features will reach an inflection point over the next several years, though vehicles aren't expected to be able to do all the driving.  ""More and more vehicles will have standard equipment with basic automation like lane-keeping assist, automated braking and left-hand turn assistance,"" Rickert said. ""Those things that can detect blind spots and tell one vehicle whether another is about to turn, will reduce more accidents.""  However, Level 5 autonomy, where a vehicle can go any place at any time without intervention by a human, isn't expected to be widely available until after 2030.  ""I do see those types of vehicles being used in geo-gated areas where they can be more controlled,"" Ricker said. ""Whereas wider deployment on interstate highways, it's going to take a while to get there.""

All Rights Reserved","SAN FRANCISCO - Tesla is recalling more than 360,000 vehicles equipped with its Full Self-Driving Beta software over apparent crash risks, according to a government regulator, the biggest setback yet for technology that Tesla has tied heavily to its valuation and future ambitions.  Officials said the software - part of Tesla's driver-assistance package - is being recalled because of the vehicles' failure to stop at intersections or exercise proper caution at yellow signals, come to a complete stop at stop signs, as well as adhere to posted speed limits. The company says it will send a remote update to remedy the problem, as it has done with past recalls.","It is the widest recall yet for the software, which has garnered widespread attention for Tesla's promises to leverage it to make vehicles autonomous.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said successfully executing on self-driving is ""the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money and being worth basically zero.""  In its current form, Full Self-Driving Beta is a set of features that allows Tesla vehicles to maneuver city and residential streets, accelerating and stopping, making turns and navigating a route, without the physical input of the driver. Drivers are supposed to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention at all times.  The recall notice, dated Wednesday, was posted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website this week. It affects 362,758 vehicles, including Tesla models dating back to 2016.  ""The FSD Beta system may allow the vehicle to act unsafe around intersections, such as traveling straight through an intersection while in a turn-only lane, entering a stop sign-controlled intersection without coming to a complete stop, or proceeding into an intersection during a steady yellow traffic signal without due caution,"" the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration wrote in a letter. ""In addition, the system may respond insufficiently to changes in posted speed limits or not adequately account for the driver's adjustment of the vehicle's speed to exceed posted speed limits.""  Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  In a post on Twitter on Thursday, Musk argued the need for a software update should not constitute a recall by the traditional definition.  ""The word 'recall' for an over-the-air software update is anachronistic and just flat wrong!"" he tweeted.  The recall adds to an emerging series of challenges for the software and, following Musk's acquisition of Twitter, for Tesla itself. Tesla has shed hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of value since Musk set out to buy the social media site he now heads, though the electric vehicle company has recovered some of those losses this year.  Meanwhile, regulatory and public scrutiny has mounted since Full Self-Driving's wide release: the Justice Department has requested documents related to Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, Tesla confirmed in a regulatory filing last month, and a Tesla critic funded a Super Bowl commercial highlighting alleged flaws with the software.  Investors have expressed concern that Musk's focus on Twitter has the potential to take momentum away from Tesla.  Tesla had recalled Full Self-Driving Beta in the past, but not since making the software widely available to drivers who purchase the option, which costs $15,000 per vehicle.  Full Self-Driving Beta is a part of Tesla's larger driver-assistance suite, Autopilot, which allows vehicles to navigate from highway on-ramp to off-ramp, though drivers are supposed to monitor it at all times. Full Self-Driving expands the capabilities of Autopilot to city and residential streets.  In the past, Tesla had patched issues without immediate public notice through software updates, which are sometimes known as ""stealth recalls.""  But regulators have pressured Tesla to be more forthcoming about issues with its software. That has prompted a steady stream of recall notices in recent years, sometimes to the chagrin of Tesla and Musk.  Aaron Gregg contributed to this report.

Tesla workers in New York state are launching a unionization campaign, teeing up a potential first for the electric-vehicle maker and the latest labor challenge for chief executive Elon Musk.  The employees, who label data for Tesla's Autopilot technology at the company's plant in Buffalo, sent an email to Musk early Tuesday with their intent to unionize. Employees say they're seeking better pay and job security alongside a reduction in production pressures that they say have been harmful to their health.  Workers at the plant told Bloomberg News that Tesla monitors keystrokes to track how long employees spend per task and how much of the day they spend actively working, leading some to avoid taking bathroom breaks, six employees said.  ""People are tired of being treated like robots,"" said Al Celli, a member of the union's organizing committee.  If successful, the union would be a first for Tesla, which unlike other leading automakers has successfully resisted unionization at its U.S. factories.  Musk and Tesla's human resources chief did not respond to emailed inquiries. Tesla disbanded its media relations team in 2020.  - Bloomberg News  Also in Business  Christine Wilson, the sole Republican on the Federal Trade Commission, announced she is resigning from the agency over her fierce opposition to liberal FTC Chair Lina Khan's agenda. Wilson, who has spent months publicly criticizing Khan's efforts to crack down on corporate power using antitrust laws, said she is resigning because of Khan's ""defiance of legal precedent and her abuse of power to achieve desired outcomes."" Wilson's departure will leave the FTC without a Republican leader, although an effort is underway to nominate a new Republican to sit on the commission soon. Republican FTC Commissioner Noah Phillips stepped down from the agency late last year. The FTC declined to comment.  Hyundai and Kia will offer software upgrades for 8.3 million U.S. vehicles to help curb increasing car thefts using a method popularized on TikTok and other social media channels, the Korean automakers said Monday. TikTok videos showing how to steal cars made from 2015 to 2019 without push-button ignitions and immobilizing anti-theft devices have spread nationwide. That had led to at least 14 reported crashes and eight fatalities, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said.  Ford Motor has temporarily halted production and stopped shipments of its hot-selling F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck over an unidentified problem with its battery. Ford confirmed it had stopped building the plug-in pickup at its factory in Dearborn, Mich., while engineers seek a solution to a ""potential quality issue"" discovered on a truck at the plant. Ford said in an emailed statement that it is not delivering trucks that are in transit to dealers. Demand for the Lightning has been strong since Ford began selling the battery-powered model of the best-selling vehicle in the United States last April.  - From news services   CT 	 http://www.washingtonpost.com[http://www.washingtonpost.com]  RF 	 WP20230215digest0215  CO 	 tata : Tata Group | boeing : The Boeing Company | nia : Airbus SE | tsonsl : Tata Sons Ltd  IN 	 i364 : Aerospace Products/Parts | i3640010 : Civil Aircraft | i8396 : Diversified Holding Companies | iaer : Aerospace/Defense | ibcs : Business/Consumer Services | iindstrls : Industrial Goods  NS 	 ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | nnam : News Agency Materials | ncdig : Corporate Digests | ncat : Content Types | nfact : Factiva Filters | nfce : C&E Exclusion Filter | niwe : IWE Filter  RE 	 india : India | usa : United States | asiaz : Asia | bric : BRICS Countries | devgcoz : Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : Developing Economies | namz : North America | sasiaz : South Asia  IPD 	 National-Economy  PUB 	 Washington Post",NA
"Document WP00000020230212ej2c0001d","A-Section","Critic blitzes Tesla with a Super Bowl ad","Gerrit De Vynck Faiz Siddiqui","1437 words","12 February 2023","The Washington Post","WP","FINAL","A03",NA,"English","Copyright 2023, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved","SAN FRANCISCO - Electric carmaker Tesla is facing multiple challenges and distractions right now. This Super Bowl Sunday it will get another one, shown to audiences across the country.  California tech entrepreneur Dan O'Dowd, who has already poured millions of his own money into a campaign to get Tesla's Full Self-Driving tech banned from public roads, is funding a Super Bowl commercial that will play in D.C. and a handful of state capitals, including Austin, Tallahassee, Albany, Atlanta and Sacramento.","The ad shows a Tesla Model 3 that O'Dowd says has Full Self-Driving turned on running into a child-size mannequin, crossing over the centerline into oncoming traffic, driving past ""do not enter"" signs, passing a school bus with its flashing stop lights on and hitting a stroller in the road.  Tesla has released the latest version of its Full Self-Driving tech - which allows the car to maneuver city and residential streets without human input - to around 400,000 people in North America, quadrupling the number of people using it during much of 2022. That has renewed questions about the tech's safety. Government investigators are looking into whether Tesla's driver-assistance features caused crashes. And in January, a report emerged that a former Tesla engineer had testified that a 2016 demo of in which the company claimed one of its cars was driving itself was actually staged.  Some politicians, including Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), have called for more oversight over Tesla's tech. But O'Dowd says he's making the investment in a new ad campaign because he wants to pressure politicians to make it a bigger priority.  Tesla doesn't advertise its cars in the traditional way, so the Super Bowl ad could reach people who don't already have a strong idea of what the company is, said Gene Munster, a longtime stock analyst and managing partner of Deepwater Asset Management. That said, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk is a ""master of spin"" and will just keep moving forward with his plans even if the ad generates bad publicity for him, Munster said.  ""At the end of the day he's just going to keep plowing forward with this until somebody, some governing body, tells him he can't,"" he said.  Musk did not respond to a request for comment. In the past, Musk has called O'Dowd crazy, and many of his supporters have accused O'Dowd of having a conflict of interest because his company, Green Hills Software, sells to Intel-owned Mobileye, which makes a computer chip that runs driver-assist software.  O'Dowd says that Mobileye is just one of hundreds of customers and that his motivation is driven purely by his concerns about the safety of Tesla's technology. He owns several Teslas himself and is especially fond of the Roadster, the first model the company produced.  Last year, Tesla issued a cease-and-desist letter after O'Dowd's group, the Dawn Project, published footage of the cars repeatedly striking child-size mannequins. A test run by a prominent Musk supporter included a real child to show the car recognizing the child and stopping. O'Dowd has offered to run the test with Musk or any of his other critics in-person, to prove the car is making the mistakes without any tampering.  Full Self-Driving is a set of features that enables Tesla vehicles to accelerate, steer, make turns and maneuver a car along a route on city and residential streets without physical input. It is part of Tesla's Autopilot driver-assistance package, but the ability to access the expanded features costs $15,000.  The company has led the way in pushing out driver-assistance features billed as steppingstones toward autonomy. Many other automakers provide lane-keeping, automatic braking and the ability for a car to keep a certain distance from the vehicle in front of it. But Tesla's Full Self-Driving has gone further, essentially letting the car maneuver itself beyond just on highways and onto busy city streets, though the company does caution drivers to remain alert and keep their hands on the steering wheel at all times.  Tesla pioneered the mass market for electric vehicles and began touting its self-driving ambitions in 2016. But it has had a rough few months.  In late January, as Musk stood trial for a 2018 tweet in which he declared he had ""funding secured"" to take the company private at $420 a share, a news report from Reuters revealed a top executive's testimony that Tesla's original self-driving video from 2016 was staged. Musk, meanwhile, had been distracted with Twitter as Tesla investors put pressure on him to turn his attention back to the company that is the source of much of his net worth.  After peaking at more than $1.2 trillion in valuation in late 2021, Tesla's stock price dove during 2022, as higher interest rates, Musk's chaotic takeover of Twitter and concerns about slowing demand and increased competition led many to sell their shares.  Now there are further signs that Tesla's Full Self-Driving Beta is falling short of its ambitions. Despite continual software updates, cars are repeating the same mistakes they have made for years: driving down light-rail tracks they should know are off-limits, video footage showed, or suddenly braking when there are no obstacles in the way.  Tesla has argued that its driver-assistance suite, Autopilot, is safer than normal driving, with Musk calling Autopilot ""unequivocally safer"" when crash data is compared. And the company has touted improvements to the software with its steady stream of releases.  Beyond the issues with Full Self-Driving, Tesla is facing a situation in which older, larger automakers have committed to electric vehicles, and Musk's public embrace of right-wing politics and culture war issues turns off some of his potential customers. Musk himself has said that successfully building self-driving software is ""the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money and being worth basically zero.""  The technology is highly controversial, with some Tesla supporters saying it can easily take people on long drives without the need for intervention, and other users saying it makes repeated, dangerous mistakes. The latest version of the tech has generally been available to a group of tens of thousands of Tesla owners who the company says it has vetted.  Tesla Autopilot, the driver-assistance suite that encompasses Full Self-Driving Beta, is facing multiple investigations from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The investigations relate to more than a dozen crashes with parked emergency vehicles while Autopilot was activated, and Tesla vehicles' tendency to suddenly brake for imaginary hazards, a phenomenon known as ""phantom braking.""  Lucia Sanchez, a spokesperson for NHTSA, declined to comment on the open investigation.  Meanwhile, Tesla confirmed in a regulatory filing last month that the Department of Justice had requested documents related to Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, part of an ongoing probe. Public scrutiny has mounted over the performance of the software as more vehicles equipped with it have hit the roads.  In January, the Intercept published footage of an eight-vehicle crash on the San Francisco Bay Bridge that allegedly was prompted by a Tesla using driver-assistance features, which abruptly braked in traffic, injuring nine people including a 2-year-old child, according to the report. The crash came not long after Musk announced the wide release of Full Self-Driving Beta to any users in the United States and Canada who had purchased the option - which was previously restricted to approved beta testers.  O'Dowd's Super Bowl ad is the first volley in a broader new media campaign that will target lawmakers across the country. O'Dowd says he hopes politicians will enact new laws regulating the testing of driver-assistance and autonomous driving features, and pressure regulators such as NHTSA, to speed up their investigations of the technology. Currently, carmakers can add new driver-assistance features - even those marketed as part of a self-driving package - as long as they warn drivers to stay alert at all times.  That isn't enough for O'Dowd and other critics of the technology. ""There isn't any urgency,"" he said. By hammering politicians with videos of the car making dangerous errors, O'Dowd says he hopes the government will move faster.  ""It needs to come off the road,"" he added.

"Document WP00000020221225eicp0000i","A-Section","Musk's Twitter drama depletes his stature","Faiz Siddiqui","2326 words","25 December 2022","The Washington Post","WP","FINAL","A01",NA,"English","Copyright 2022, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved","Elon Musk was speechless.  The Twitter CEO was on a live audio chat Tuesday night with software engineers when one user started quizzing him about the internal workings of the company's systems. Musk, who hours earlier said he would keep control of Twitter's software systems even though he plans to relinquish the CEO role, said the company's code needed a complete rewrite. One of the participants asked what he meant - pushing for him to explain it from top to bottom.","""Amazing, wow,"" Musk said after hesitations and pauses. ""You're a jackass. … What a moron.""  The incident highlights the new reality facing Musk, who also runs Tesla and SpaceX: a crisis of confidence in his once-unquestioned brilliance.  That crisis accelerated as Tesla's stock price plunged nearly 20 percent last week to $123 per share on Friday, largely because of concerns about Musk. Also last week, roughly 58 percent of 17 million Twitter accounts that responded to an unscientific poll from Musk said he should step down as Twitter CEO, after helping create, then reverse new policies that proved controversial last weekend.  ""Historically he's been a pendulum between genius and reckless,"" said Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures. ""He's on reckless right now. He's way over recklessness.""  He added, ""It leaves people to view him … as slightly less of a genius.""  Musk has built his reputation on having a Midas touch with the companies he runs - something many investors and experts thought he would bring to Twitter when he purchased it for $44 billion in October, paying nearly twice as much as it was worth by some analyst estimates. He is known for sleeping on the factory floor at Tesla, demanding long hours and quick turnarounds from his workers. He is seen as an engineering genius, propelling promises of cars that can drive themselves and rockets that can take humans to Mars.  But that image is unraveling. Some Twitter employees who worked with Musk are doubtful his management style will allow him to turn the company around. And some investors in Tesla, by far the biggest source of his wealth, have begun to see him as a liability. Musk's distraction has prompted questions about leadership of SpaceX as well, though it is much less reliant on his active involvement. Meanwhile, Neuralink and Boring Co., two companies he founded, lag on promises.  Musk's net worth - largely fueled by his stake in Tesla, which has fallen by more than half in 2022 - has plunged this year from roughly $270 billion to below $140 billion on Friday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That fall has relieved him of the title of the world's richest man and called into question his ability to keep up with his billions of dollars in loans.  Musk is repeatedly described as a man obsessed with Twitter in all the wrong ways, who is failing at protecting both his new investment and his previous ones, according to interviews with a half-dozen former Twitter employees and people in Musk's orbit, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution or because they were not authorized to speak publicly about company matters.  Musk last week said Twitter is in a financial hole and facing a cash crunch - even as it slashed more than half of the workforce and closed offices.  ""We have an emergency fire drill on our hands,"" Musk said on Twitter Spaces. ""Aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""  Musk has always been unpredictable and freewheeling with his public persona, but with Twitter, his actions have directly affected the business, turning off some of the company's users and pushing away advertisers, said Jo-Ellen Pozner, a management professor at Santa Clara University's Leavey School of Business.  ""It really feels destabilizing for the whole Twitter community,"" she said, adding that the reputation of a CEO does affect businesses and their stock prices - and could even prompt consumers to choose another vehicle.  Musk and Twitter - which has disbanded most of its public relations team - did not respond to requests for comment.  Holed up in a 10th-floor conference room  Musk, who is South African and migrated to North America as a teenager, first forged his image as a tech wizard by founding the company that became PayPal. He funneled much of his approximately $165 million in gains from the sale of PayPal into two ventures: Tesla and SpaceX. SpaceX went on to become the most successful private spaceflight company in history, pioneering reusable rockets and launching astronauts to the International Space Station.  Tesla, meanwhile, brought electric vehicles to the mainstream with sleek, fast and competitively priced sedans and SUVs that shattered the frumpy image of eco-conscious cars. His closest allies have held out faith even as he has missed major deadlines for selling new vehicle models and rolling out self-driving technology.  Musk has been focused almost solely on Twitter since he bought it, planning to reinvent the company as an engineering-driven operation. He immediately ousted Twitter's previous executives and embarked on a campaign of harsh layoffs that cut the company in half. Many of Musk's supporters, who had followed his rise at Tesla, gave him the benefit of the doubt that he had a plan to transform Twitter.  But he immediately spooked advertisers by engaging in a baseless accusation about the attack on Paul Pelosi and dialed back Twitter's content moderation, prompting calls from civil rights groups for advertisers to suspend their marketing on the site. And he had to pull back his first major product launch - Twitter Blue Verified - after a day, when impersonators wreaked havoc.  Musk appears to be struggling to grasp Twitter's business, the people said, and he demands a stance from his employees that stifles discussion of problems. ""He doesn't see from the zoom-out view at all,"" one of the people close to Musk and his team said, describing him as ""uncovering and solving and programming all night.""  He has been holed up in a 10th-floor conference area with a staging room for visitors - where they often remain for more than an hour before being called in. They are instructed not to speak until Musk does. And when they do finally meet with him, he's sometimes watching YouTube videos.  Many staffers have learned they can't rely on the erratic and unpredictable Musk, even as he makes assurances about the various facets of the company they have raised as concerns.  The driving team behind Project Eraser - which carries out functions such as deleting the user data of those who ask, part of compliance with federal requirements - has been gutted. Musk has brought in a new roster of leaders, many of them loyalists.  When one executive met with Musk and voiced concerns about the Federal Trade Commission's consent decree, Musk assured that person there was nothing to worry about. He said Tesla had plenty of experience on privacy matters, and pointed to his deep knowledge and awareness of the constraints Twitter was under.  Minutes after the meeting concluded, a Musk subordinate emailed: Could the executive send over a copy of the consent decree they had just discussed?  Instead of focusing on plans to make the site a competitor to YouTube with video and rolling out other new features that earn revenue, he instead got sucked into the culture wars, the people said.  That took the form of the Twitter Files, an examination by some journalists of many of the company's actions before Musk's arrival, such as the blocking of a New York Post story that dug into the contents of Hunter Biden's laptop and the ban on former president Donald Trump.  Musk chose Bari Weiss, a former New York Times columnist, as one of the writers invited inside the company to go through documents.  ""Please give Bari full access to everything at Twitter,"" Musk wrote to a subordinate in a Signal message viewed by The Washington Post. ""No limits at all.""  That was concerning to many inside Twitter - particularly those familiar with the 2011 FTC settlement after hacks of high-profile accounts, including that of then-President Barack Obama. Staffers responsible for her onboarding pushed back and refused to grant Weiss the full access Musk had requested, believing it would violate the settlement.  One former employee described that step as ""super unprecedented"" and ""highly inappropriate,"" saying Twitter would never have granted that level of access to an outside party who might suddenly be able to read direct messages, for example.  The pushback, however, was not taken as seriously at senior levels.  Days later, Musk announced deputy general counsel Jim Baker had been ""exited"" from the company, as the CEO cited what he called his ""possible role in suppression of information important to the public dialogue."" Former employees said it would have been normal for an attorney to review documents for release.  That same day, Alan Rosa, Twitter's chief information security officer in charge of access matters, was fired from the company as well. Employees that week found Weiss's name searchable in Slack, the company's internal messaging service. But her access was overseen by a chaperone, new Twitter Trust and Safety chief Ella Irwin.  Irwin's name appeared in a watermark on the Twitter Files. When Twitter suspended more than half a dozen journalists this month over alleged violations of its rules on doxing - the sharing of private information - the suspensions were labeled in internal systems ""direction of Ella.""  Musk had also publicized an old message from his previous Trust and Safety head and taken aim at Twitter executives, unleashing a swarm of criticism on employees - sometimes while they were still working for the company.  ""These guys did amazing damage,"" one former employee said of Musk's circle at Twitter, which included employees of his other companies and friends who lacked expertise on Twitter. ""They are basically bullying their way to getting 'super god' access to these things. All they're doing is they're witch hunting for Elon, so they can find people talking [about him] so they can fire them.""  Musk is running the newly private company largely on his instincts - mirroring the workflows of his other major technology company: Tesla. The electric car company, the world's most valuable automaker, has eschewed market research in its dominance of the electric vehicle space, seeding the automotive industry with a raw and authentic expressions of Musk's id.  At Tesla, employees often find out about deadlines and major product changes through tweeted edicts. But they have also grown used to the CEO's shoot-from-the-hip attitude, his reliance on his gut instincts rather than the research and development arms typical of multibillion-dollar corporations.  The unraveling  But Tesla's stock price has plummeted - which Musk frequently attributes to economic trends.  ""As bank savings account interest rates, which are guaranteed, start to approach stock market returns, which are *not* guaranteed, people will increasingly move their money out of stocks into cash, thus causing stocks to drop,"" he said in a tweet Tuesday.  But analysts have pointed to problems more specific to Tesla and concern with Musk's time at Twitter, suggesting in essence that the sheen has worn off a company whose value was not rooted in its fundamentals.  ""I felt for a while he was given a pass,"" said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at the website iSeeCars. ""'Oh, it's Elon. He's Midas: If he's touching it, it's going to be successful.' Now a certain number of people have stopped giving him a pass on things that probably should have been looked at a little more critically or acknowledged as potential downside.""  The crisis in confidence in his leadership accelerated when Musk began making changes to Twitter to address his personal problems and concerns.  Earlier this month, he reneged on a previous commitment to allow an account on Twitter that published the location of his private jet, which he held up as an example of his free speech principles. After abruptly suspending @ElonJet, Twitter suspended journalists who tweeted about it, drawing ire from both sides of the political spectrum.  He launched a poll, which directed Musk to allow them back on the site.  ""The people have spoken,"" he tweeted that Friday.  Musk jetted to Qatar for the World Cup final on Sunday, where he was spotted alongside former president Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and Qatari leaders.  That day, Twitter announced a new policy: It was banning the promotion of outside social media sites on its platform, including Facebook, Instagram and Trump-backed Truth Social. Users would no longer be able to promote outside links to those sites and others. Twitter said cross-posting of content would be allowed, but it would no longer permit ""free promotion.""  The criticism was swift, and even loyalists expressed concern. Musk apologized.  ""Going forward, there will be a vote for major policy changes,"" he tweeted. ""My apologies. Won't happen again.""  Then Musk launched a new poll. ""Should I step down as head of Twitter?"" he wrote in a tweet. ""I will abide by the results of this poll.""  By Monday morning, the result was clear that Musk should step down. He went silent on the platform for much of the day - one of his longer stretches as a prolific tweeter to his more than 120 million followers. He responded to a few tweets later in the day calling the results into question.  On Tuesday, he said he would resign - with caveats.  ""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" he wrote in a tweet. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""

But many in Washington, even as they praise his work in areas of national security, now see Musk as too powerful and too reckless.  Citing Musk's public ridicule of those who snub him - the billionaire has called President Biden a ""damp sock puppet"" and said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) reminds him of ""my friend's angry mom"" - many of the two dozen top government officials interviewed for this article would only speak about Musk on the condition of anonymity. But nearly all described him as being as erratic and arrogant as he is brilliant.  ""Elon, The Everywhere"" is what one White House official called him. ""He believes he is such a gift to mankind that he doesn't need any guardrails, that he knows best.""  ""He sees himself as above the presidency,"" said Jill Lepore, a Harvard historian who hosted podcasts on Musk.  Musk declined to comment for this story, but he says he weighs in on important problems and described his mission as ""enhancing the future of humanity."" He said his Ukraine plan could avert possible nuclear war, and that his Taiwan proposal could ease dangerous regional tensions.  But Musk's freelance diplomacy is angering allies at the same time he takes over a media platform with hundreds of millions of users.  ""The bottom line is that people hang on his every word because he has delivered so many times,"" said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.). ""I hope he shows some respect for that responsibility.""  Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) called Musk's plan for Ukraine an ""affront"" to its people, and even suggested that federal subsidies that help makers of electric cars might be better spent.  Musk's relationship with Washington started out strong. ""I love you!"" Musk blurted out when a NASA official called to tell him in 2008 that he got a $1.6 billion contract at a time when he was heavily in debt. Washington then poured billions more into Musk's company as it developed its rockets and space capsule. SpaceX delivered, rebuilding the flagging U.S. space program.  His bipartisan efforts once helped him win over Washington. He dined with President Barack Obama and joined President Donald Trump's economic councils. He donated to candidates of both parties. Now, he bashes Biden and says he plans to vote for a Republican president in 2024.  These days, the eccentric entrepreneur rarely visits Washington and is increasingly critical of the federal government. He does talk to foreign presidents and prime ministers, according to people who work directly with him. Musk sells his state-of-the-art rockets and aerospace technology to South Korea, Turkey and a growing list of other countries. He has Tesla factories in Germany and China. He also owns and controls more than 3,000 satellites circling the Earth - far more than any nation, including the United States.  In May, Brazilian officials said Musk met with Jair Bolsonaro, the right-wing ultranationalist who lost his bid for reelection as president this week. Musk said he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin 18 months ago, but denied a report that he talked to Putin just before offering his Ukrainian peace plan that was widely condemned as pro-Russian.  Though Musk needs Washington less now that he is a global powerhouse, Washington continues to depend on him. The U.S. military uses his rockets and satellite communications services for its drones, ships and aircraft. NASA has no way to get American astronauts to the International Space Station without his space capsule. And, at a time when climate change is a top White House priority, he has more electric cars on U.S. roads than any other manufacturer.  Several top government officials said they are working on decreasing their reliance on Musk, including partnering with and nurturing competitors with government contracts and subsidies. ""There's not just SpaceX. There are other entities that we can certainly partner with when it comes to providing Ukraine what they need on the battlefield,"" Sabrina Singh, deputy Pentagon press secretary, told reporters in October.  A key concern now that Musk has completed his purchase of Twitter is his web of overseas holdings and foreign investors, including his massive Tesla factory in China, and possible leverage others could have over Musk now that he controls a platform where some users have spread misinformation and ratcheted up political divisiveness. As a U.S. defense contractor, Musk has been vetted, but several top officials said they wanted a more thorough review, including of any expansion plans in Russia and China. Warren and others have called his Twitter purchase a ""danger to democracy.""  Washington has dealt before with powerful tycoons who dominated railroads, oil or a key economic sector, said Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. ""But what's a bit different here is Musk's ability to project his political agenda and the fact that now that we have technology and media that allows individuals to essentially become their own network or channel,"" Haass said.  Because Musk has business investments in China, and, according to Russian and other news reports, said last year at a Kremlin-sponsored event for students that he was planning one in Russia, several top U.S. government officials wonder if Musk's business interests affect his views on foreign affairs.  The economic turmoil since the Ukraine war began has dented the fortunes of many people including Musk, whose personal wealth dropped by tens of billions, to about $210 billion, according to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index.  Two people who know him well said Musk is impulsive and that makes him say things that harm his own interests - a tendency that makes it difficult for government officials to count on Musk. Musk himself has said he has Asperger's, a form of autism, and no one should expect him to be a ""chill, normal dude.""  ""He shoots himself in the foot all the time. He should not be getting into politics,"" said one person who has worked with him for years.  ""I have been as shocked as anyone these last few months at some of the things he has waded into,"" said Lori Garver, former deputy administrator at NASA. She worries about the consequences. SpaceX restored U.S. leadership in space, but his politically charged comments attract critics who are starting to ask, ""Why is taxpayer money going to this billionaire?""  ""It's disappointing,"" she said.  Shifting power  Musk set his sights on D.C. 20 years ago. A South African who moved to Silicon Valley, Musk became a U.S. citizen in 2002 - the year he used his payment from the sale of PayPal, the electronic payment firm he helped found, to start SpaceX. It was a big risk, and he needed high-dollar government contracts to survive. In early 2003, Musk announced he would have a ""significant presence"" in the nation's capital so that he could build a ""close working relationship with the federal government.""  He invested in Tesla around the same time and soon took over running it, tapping into financial subsidies and tax credits Washington was offering to wean the country off gasoline. California alone gave Tesla $3.2 billion in subsidies, according to figures provided by the office of California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D).  A review of public disclosure forms show that for brief periods of time, Musk hired dozens of lobbyists, many of them former staff members of powerful members of Congress. Rohan Patel, who worked on energy and transportation in the Obama White House, runs Tesla's regulatory and legislative affairs in Washington.  SpaceX has spent more than $22 million to lobby Washington over the years, according to OpenSecrets, a research group tracking money in politics. Musk, himself, proved a savvy political operator. He flew into Washington 40 times between 2008 and 2013, according to flight records obtained by Musk biographer Ashlee Vance. He knocked on doors and invited officials to breakfast.  When backroom persuasion didn't get results, he learned that publicity helps.  On a sunny Wednesday in June 2014, Musk parked his new ""space taxi"" a few blocks from Capitol Hill. He had hauled the capsule designed to carry seven astronauts into orbit across the country from his California factory and invited TV cameras, along with government officials, to check it out.  ""Great job, Elon!"" yelled Dana Rohrabacher, a Republican member of Congress, as he climbed out of the sleek spacecraft. Democrats applauded, too, that day. Musk was beaming. He was about to get richer.  The United States then relied on Russia to carry American astronauts to the International Space Station, paying Moscow tens of millions of dollars for each seat. Musk promised he would put an end to that and rebuild the American space program. Obama was in the White House and wanted to let private companies like SpaceX try. Weeks after Musk brought his space taxi to D.C., NASA awarded him a $2.6 billion contract.  Musk also pursued Pentagon contracts and found public confrontation helped. In a sparsely attended Capitol Hill hearing in 2014, he made headlines by slamming the joint venture between aerospace giants Lockheed Martin and Boeing that supplied rockets to the Air Force. He called it a ""monopoly"" and said it was vastly overcharging taxpayers.  ""Elon was saying, 'Give me a chance,'"" said Scott Pace, a former NASA official who spoke at that hearing.  The Pentagon did, and Musk delivered. His game-changing, partly reusable Falcon rockets were considerably less expensive.  Now, just eight years later, Musk is the goliath of the space industry. And Musk's success has shifted the dynamic with Washington.  Democrats are more vocal on the need to rein in Musk.  House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) calls Musk ""my good friend,"" and Musk spoke at his August fundraiser. In June, Musk, who recently moved from California to Texas, announced he voted for Mayra Flores in a congressional primary - and said it was the first time he voted for a Republican. He also bashed Democrats as too extreme and too controlled by unions and publicly predicted a ""massive red wave"" in November.  But some Republican lawmakers are skeptical Musk's new coziness with the GOP will last. ""He's another bullshit artist"" is how former president Donald Trump described Musk at a July rally in Alaska.  A rare area of bipartisan agreement is that for certain vital issues, especially national security, the United States should not depend on any one person or company, and the federal government is making moves to lessen dependence on Musk.  NASA has funded Boeing's Starliner capsule to compete with SpaceX to transport astronauts. (Blue Origin, which is owned by Jeff Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post, is also a competitor for NASA contracts.) NASA officials said Starliner's delays and higher cost show why SpaceX is so dominant. ""But still, we need a second option,"" said one influential member of Congress.  The Federal Communications Commission in August decided it would not give SpaceX's Starlink - which is now operating in 40 countries - a $900 million subsidy to bring broadband to rural areas even though that money had been provisionally granted in the waning days of the Trump administration. The FCC said the $600 satellite dish a home would need to purchase from SpaceX was a factor. A top SpaceX official called the rejection ""unreasonable"" and ""grossly unfair.""  Congress also has been encouraging Ford and other automakers to build electric cars. A new condition on a federal $7,500 rebate is that the price of the new car cannot top $55,000. Most Tesla models cost more.  But Musk will be eligible for many subsidies and incentives, including for his electric charging stations. He just announced his Superchargers are now in 46 countries.  Musk hates ""a false narrative out there that he is a grifter who survived off government handouts,"" said Eric Berger, author of ""Liftoff,"" a history of SpaceX. ""He sees the government as a double-edge sword,"" Berger said. It can help but its bureaucracy slows him down. ""He is really frustrated by the dizzying array of federal agencies that he has to deal with - and the bigger he gets, the more there is.""  ""Those bastards"" is how Musk refers to officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC fined Musk and Tesla $20 million each after Musk tweeted that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private at $420 a share, after finding that was not true. The SEC is also now investigating Musk in connection with his Twitter takeover, including whether he complied with disclosure laws. Musk's lawyer told a judge that the SEC was trying to ""muzzle and harass"" the businessman because he is an ""outspoken critic of the government.""  Musk believes Tesla's driver assistance system will save many lives and has said he is irritated by the publicity around the federal safety investigation into his Autopilot system. But government officials say it's worth looking into whether the self-driving system was a factor in crashes, including some that were fatal.  Avoiding confrontation  Few want a head-on confrontation with Musk.  Biden got into one after Musk was not invited to a White House conference on electric vehicles in August 2021. Musk tweeted that the snub was the ""next level of insanity,"" and that Biden was controlled by unions. Musk also has been drawing attention to any Biden misstep, including when he mistakenly read instructions meant only for him on his teleprompter.  Apart from not wanting to get on his bad side, many in Washington admire his accomplishments and want to work with him. At the Pentagon, there are many who see Musk as a secret weapon. His Starlink satellite systems mean Ukrainian soldiers have real-time information about military targets, and other countries are looking at how it can help their defense efforts.  In April, the White House said Musk was invited to a discussion about electric cars and charging stations and did make an appearance by teleconferencing.  ""We used to be on the same page. Now, we are not always. It's great when we are,"" said one member of Congress. ""One thing is clear: Musk believes he knows best, and he will do whatever he wants - and that can be good and it can be bad.""  Meanwhile, Musk is also working on an ever-growing number of ventures, from building robots that can cook dinner to plans for colonizing Mars.  Lepore, the historian, said Musk's power is not like anything the country has seen before. ""We should be worried, not because it's inevitable that his influence would be malignant, but it's inevitable that it would be a huge influence.""

"Document WP00000020220826ei8q0001u","A-Section","Tesla demands removal of video of cars hitting child-size mannequins","Faiz Siddiqui Gerrit De Vynck","855 words","26 August 2022","The Washington Post","WP","FINAL","A17",NA,"English","Copyright 2022, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved","SAN FRANCISCO - Tesla is demanding that an advocacy group take down videos of its vehicles striking child-size mannequins, alleging the footage is defamatory and misrepresents its most advanced driver-assistance software.  In a cease-and-desist letter obtained by The Post, Tesla objects to a video commercial by anti- ""Full Self-Driving"" group the Dawn Project that appears to show the electric vehicles running over mannequins at speeds over 20 mph while allegedly using the technology. The commercial urges banning the Tesla Full Self-Driving Beta software, which enables cars on city and residential streets to automatically lane-keep, change lanes and steer.","The commercial led to a surge of news articles and criticism of Tesla's software, which is being tested in an early-release version by more than 100,000 users on public streets in countries including the United States and Canada. It also triggered blowback from Tesla supporters who said the test could have been manipulated. Some of them sought to re-create the demonstrations - sometimes involving real children - in an effort to show that Tesla's software does actually work.  The back and forth is the latest escalation in an ongoing spat between Tesla's vocal fan community and critics of its driver-assistance software.  The man behind the Dawn Project, tech founder and billionaire Dan O'Dowd, has become an unlikely and controversial leader of the latter group. He runs Green Hills Software, which makes operating systems for airplanes and cars, potentially making him a competitor in the market for car software. He also ran for the U.S. Senate this year, and broadcast his videos on TV and online as campaign ads. (One such ad features reporting from The Washington Post, which was not involved.)  O'Dowd says his motivation for going after Tesla is a conviction that the technology, like many other pieces of software that people rely on in the modern world, isn't safe enough and needs to be redesigned - and in this case needs to be banned.  ""We have been busy hooking up and putting computers in charge of the things that millions of people's lives depend on: self-driving cars is one of those,"" O'Dowd said.  Full Self-Driving Beta is still in development and is typically used by approved drivers who have qualified after a safety screening or have otherwise been granted access. A $12,000 software upgrade makes vehicles capable of receiving it - though the price is soon to go up. Tesla doesn't claim the software is autonomous, and the system requires the driver to be alert at all times - issuing escalating warnings if a driver is not paying attention before turning off the features.  Tesla has pointed to the ability of technologies like its Autopilot driver-assistance system to ""reduce the frequency and severity of traffic crashes and save thousands of lives each year."" Musk has said Autopilot is ""unequivocally safer"" than normal driving.  Musk and Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.  Regulatory and police agencies have urged users not to involve children in tests or attempt to simulate safety demonstrations, which are conducted under strict, tightly controlled sets of conditions.  That did not stop one Tesla superfan from conducting a test involving a child in an attempt to prove that Full Self-Driving Beta is safe, after the parent agreed to sit behind the wheel for the demo. The vehicle in the video slowly approached both a child-size mannequin and a real child, and both times slowed down and stopped. YouTube took down the video after it was flagged to the site by CNBC, the outlet reported.  The cease-and-desist letter from Tesla leaned on an investigation by the news site Electrek, which alleged that Tesla's Full Self-Driving Beta ""never engaged"" during the Dawn Project's test using mannequins. Aspects of the report have since come into question, after the Dawn Project pointed to raw data and other information indicating that Full Self-Driving was activated during the demonstrations.  ""The purported tests misuse and misrepresent the capabilities of Tesla's technology, and disregard widely recognized testing performed by independent agencies as well as the experiences shared by our customers,"" Tesla deputy general counsel Dinna Eskin wrote in the letter dated Aug. 11, the day after the Electrek article.  The letter demands the campaign immediately remove the videos and accused the group of ""unsafe and improper use"" of FSD Beta. ""Your actions actually put consumers at risk,"" Tesla alleged.  Fred Lambert, editor in chief of Electrek, pointed to what he alleged were ""serious inconsistencies"" with the footage that emerged to support the commercial's claims, and said he has repeatedly asked O'Dowd for clarification.  Cease-and-desist orders sometimes precede a lawsuit but can also be used to persuade an opponent to back down under the threat of legal action.  O'Dowd said he did not intend to take down the video commercial and instead pledged more money into the effort.

All Rights Reserved","THE NATIONAL Highway Traffic Safety Administration released a report this month on crashes involving vehicles with automated technology. Self-driving cars may not really be the problem - the problem is cars that don't drive themselves but manage to convince the drivers that they do.","The report includes data collected over a 10-month period following an order last summer that required automakers to report incidents that included cars with advanced driver-assistance systems. Fully autonomous vehicles such as Google spinoff Waymo or General Motors- controlled Cruise LLC ended up in 130 crashes, most of them occurring when the car was struck from behind, 108 of which resulted in no injuries and only one of which resulted in a serious injury. Meanwhile, cars with partially automated systems experienced nearly 400 crashes. (The NHTSA did not provide the total number of hours or miles driven.) Six people died and five were seriously injured. A previous crash in a Tesla Model S ended in a fire that took four hours and more than 30,000 gallons of water to put out.  The study is a reminder not only that the fully self-driving future many people imagine is a long way off, but also that a present in which cars can perform on their own some functions traditionally reserved for humans can prove dangerous. The NHTSA also recently upgraded a probe of Tesla Autopilot to an engineering analysis; investigators are examining the feature's responsibility for repeated collisions with parked emergency vehicles such as ambulances and police cruisers - which drivers should have been able to see about eight seconds before impact, but which they took no action to avoid until two to five seconds before impact.  The issue, it appears, may not be merely that automated systems themselves have flaws but also that drivers are relying too heavily on systems that aren't designed to do all the work without human input. After all, when something is called ""full self-driving,"" it's easy to expect, consciously or subconsciously, that it will fully drive itself. Even when software supposedly requires drivers to pay attention, the fact that a car can take care of some things can lull people into thinking the car will take care of all things - or into relaxing more generally, so that if something does go wrong they are unprepared to respond. This is what the NHTSA means when it says it will examine whether Tesla Autopilot ""may exacerbate human factors or behavioral safety risks.""  So far, there's no data to show whether partial-automation features render driving safer or less safe. The NHTSA could certainly try to make the former more likely by imposing minimum performance standards in addition to restrictions on terminology that exaggerates a vehicle's capabilities. But drivers themselves would do well to remember that the era of self-driving cars for the most part hasn't yet begun - even when they're at the wheel of a vehicle that does some of the work for them.

"Document WP00000020220616ei6g0001h","A-Section","Tesla's Autopilot involved in 273 crashes in the past year","Faiz Siddiqui Rachel Lerman Jeremy B. Merrill","1658 words","16 June 2022","The Washington Post","WP","FINAL","A16",NA,"English","Copyright 2022, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved","SAN FRANCISCO - Tesla vehicles running its Autopilot software have been involved in 273 reported crashes over roughly the past year, according to regulators, far more than previously known and providing concrete evidence regarding the real-world performance of its futuristic features.  The numbers, which were published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for the first time Wednesday, show that Tesla vehicles made up nearly 70 percent of the 392 crashes involving advanced driver-assistance systems reported since last July, and a majority of the fatalities and serious injuries - some of which date back further than a year. Eight of the Tesla crashes took place before June 2021, according to data released by NHTSA on Wednesday morning.","Previously, NHTSA said it had probed 42 crashes potentially involving driver assistance, 35 of which included Tesla vehicles, in a more limited data set that stretched back to 2016.  Of the six fatalities listed in the data set published Wednesday, five were tied to Tesla vehicles - including a July 2021 crash involving a pedestrian in Flushing, Queens, and a fatal crash in March in Castro Valley, Calif. Some dated as far back as 2019.  Tesla Autopilot is a suite of systems that allows drivers to cede physical control of their electric vehicles, though they must pay attention at all times. The cars can maintain speed and safe distance behind other cars, stay within their lane lines and make lane changes on highways. An expanded set of features, called the ""Full Self-Driving"" beta, adds the ability to maneuver city and residential streets, halting at stop signs and traffic lights, and making turns while navigating vehicles from point to point.  But some transportation safety experts have raised concerns about the technology's safety, since it is being tested and trained on public roads with other drivers. Federal officials have targeted Tesla in recent months with an increasing number of investigations, recalls and even public admonishments directed at the company.  The new data set stems from a federal order last summer requiring automakers to report crashes involving driver assistance to assess whether the technology presented safety risks. Tesla's vehicles have been found to shut off the advanced driver-assistance system, Autopilot, around one second before impact, according to the regulators.  The NHTSA order required manufacturers to disclose crashes where the software was in use within 30 seconds of the crash, in part to mitigate the concern that manufacturers would hide crashes by claiming the software wasn't in use at the time of the impact.  ""These technologies hold great promise to improve safety, but we need to understand how these vehicles are performing in real-world situations,"" NHTSA's administrator, Steven Cliff, said in a call with media about the full data set from manufacturers.  Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It has said that Autopilot is safer than normal driving when crash data is compared. The company has also pointed to the vast number of traffic crash deaths on U.S. roadways annually, estimated by NHTSA at 42,915 in 2021, hailing the promise of technologies like Autopilot to ""reduce the frequency and severity of traffic crashes and save thousands of lives each year.""  Data pitting normal driving against Autopilot is not directly comparable because Autopilot operates largely on highways. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, however, had described Autopilot as ""unequivocally safer.""  Musk said as recently as January that there had been no crashes or injuries involving the Full Self-Driving beta software, which has been rolled out to a more limited number of drivers for testing. NHTSA officials said their data was not expected to specify whether Full Self-Driving was active at the time of the crash.  The reports presents a new window into systems like Autopilot, but the database remains a work in progress - with many unknowns even in the raw data and questions left outstanding. The data does not lend itself easily to comparisons between different manufacturers, because it does not include information such as how many vehicle miles the different driver-assistance systems were used across or how widely they are deployed across carmakers' fleets.  Still, the information gives regulators a more complete look than they had before. Previously, regulators relied on a piecemeal collection of data from media reports, manufacturer notifications and other sporadic sources to learn about incidents involving advanced driver-assistance.  ""It revealed that more crashes are happening than NHTSA had previously known,"" said Phil Koopman, an engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University who focuses on autonomous vehicle safety. He noted that the reports may omit more minor crashes, including fender benders.  The data set doesn't include every piece of information that would be helpful to know, but it could be an early indication of a focus on gathering more information and using that to improve technologies and safety regulations, said Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina who studies emerging transport technologies.  ""The promise of these, the potential of these is ultimately to make driving safer,"" he said of the driver-assistance technologies. ""It's an open question whether these systems overall or individual systems have accomplished that.""  Companies such as Tesla collect more data than other automakers, which might leave them overrepresented in the data, according to experts in the systems as well as some officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly describe the findings. Tesla also pilots much of the technology, some of which comes standard on its cars, putting it in the hands of users who become familiar with it more quickly and use it in a wider variety of situations.  Several lawmakers weighed in on the report Wednesday, with some calling for greater investigation and possible safety standards for cars with the technology. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) called the findings ""cause for deep alarm.""  Blumenthal and Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) have previously criticized Tesla for putting software on the roads ""without fully considering its risks and implications."" On a call with media Wednesday, Markey called out Tesla's assertion that Autopilot technology makes cars safer.  ""This report provides further evidence slamming the brakes on those claims by Tesla,"" he said.  The senators plan to send a letter to NHTSA requesting the regulator ""take additional steps in order to protect safety,"" Markey said.  Driver-assistance technology has grown in popularity as owners have sought to hand over more of the driving tasks to automated features, which do not make the cars autonomous but can offer relief from certain physical demands of driving. Automakers such as Subaru and Honda have added driver-assistance features that act as a more advanced cruise control, keeping set distances from other vehicles, maintaining speed and following marked lane lines on highways.  But none of them operate in as broad a set of conditions, such as residential and city streets, as Tesla's systems do. NHTSA disclosed last week that Tesla's Autopilot is on around 830,000 vehicles dating to 2014.  Autopilot has spurred several regulatory probes, including into crashes with parked emergency vehicles and the cars' tendency to halt for imagined hazards.  As part of its probe into crashes with parked emergency vehicles, NHTSA has said it is looking into whether Autopilot ""may exacerbate human factors or behavioral safety risks.""  Autopilot has been tied to deaths in crashes in Williston and Delray Beach, Fla., as well as in Los Angeles County and Mountain View, Calif. The driver-assistance features have drawn the attention of NHTSA, which regulates motor vehicles, and the National Transportation Safety Board, an independent body charged with investigating safety incidents.  Federal regulators last year ordered car companies including Tesla to submit crash reports within a day of learning of any incident involving driver assistance that resulted in a death or hospitalization because of injury or that involved a person being struck. Companies are also required to report crashes involving the technology that included an air bag deployment or cars that had to be towed.  The agency said it was collecting the data because of the ""unique risks"" of the emerging technology, to determine whether manufacturers are making sure their equipment is ""free of defects that pose an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety.""  Carmakers and hardware-makers reported 46 injuries from the crashes, including five serious injuries. But the total injury rate could be higher - 294 of the crashes had an ""unknown"" number of injuries.  One additional fatality was reported, but regulators noted it wasn't clear whether the driver-assistance technology was being used.  Honda reported 90 crashes during the same time period involving advanced driver-assistance systems, and Subaru reported 10.  In a statement, Honda spokesman Chris Martin urged caution when comparing companies' crash report data, noting that the firms have different ways to collect information. Honda's reports ""are based on unverified customer statements regarding the status of ADAS systems at the time of a reported crash,"" he said.  Regulators also released data on crashes reported by automated-driving systems, which are commonly called self-driving cars. These cars are far less common on roads, loaded with sophisticated equipment and not commercially available. A total of 130 crashes were reported, including 62 from Waymo, a sister company to Google.  Waymo spokesman Nick Smith said in a statement that the company sees the value in collecting the information and said ""any reporting requirements should be harmonized across all U.S. jurisdictions to limit confusion and potentially enable more meaningful comparisons, and NHTSA's effort is a step toward achieving that goal.""  The automated-driving systems report shows no fatalities and one serious injury. There was also one report of an automated-driving crash involving Tesla, which has tested autonomous vehicles in limited capacities, though the circumstances of the incident were not immediately clear.

"Document WP00000020220610ei6a00015","A-Section","Agency boosts probe of Tesla Autopilot crashes","Faiz Siddiqui","600 words","10 June 2022","The Washington Post","WP","FINAL","A06",NA,"English","Copyright 2022, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved","SAN FRANCISCO - Federal investigators are stepping up their probe of Tesla Autopilot, the driver-assistance system that comes equipped with the electric vehicles, as they evaluate the feature's role in repeated crashes with parked emergency vehicles.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said this week it is upgrading a preliminary evaluation of the issue into an engineering analysis, a step that will let it better explore Autopilot's potential role in the crashes and a possible precursor to a recall. NHTSA is seeking to determine whether Autopilot undermines ""the effectiveness of the driver's supervision,"" according to documents describing its analysis.","The agency began evaluating the issue in August 2021, following nearly a dozen crashes under similar circumstances, which included stationary emergency vehicles such as ambulances and police cruisers, some in low-light conditions. The agency has identified 15 injuries and one death involved in the crashes, according to documents posted by the agency.  Tesla Autopilot automates some driving features, such as keeping vehicles in their lanes, making lane changes and maintaining safe distance between other vehicles. Though it allows owners to hand over some of the driving tasks to their vehicles, they are required to pay attention at all times - and their cars seek to monitor whether they are engaged.  Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Tesla has previously touted the safety of Autopilot, describing it as safer than normal driving when crash data is compared. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has called it ""unequivocally safer."" Musk has also taken aim at federal auto safety regulators over the need to issue repeated recalls, some of which were encouraged by NHTSA.  NHTSA, in its opening filing on the upgraded investigation, said it was able to step up its probe after identifying patterns across the various crashes - which it deemed worthy of further examination. The probe encompasses approximately 830,000 vehicles dating back to model year 2014, spanning Tesla's current range of models.  ""The investigation opening was motivated by an accumulation of crashes in which Tesla vehicles, operating with Autopilot engaged, struck stationary in-road or roadside first responder vehicles tending to preexisting collision scenes,"" the agency said in its report this week.  Each of the crashes occurred on ""controlled-access"" highways, it said. Drivers would have been able to spot the emergency vehicles, such as ambulances or police cruisers, an average of eight seconds before the crash, NHTSA said. But in the cases of the Autopilot crashes, ""no drivers took evasive action between 2-5 seconds prior to impact.""  NHTSA said it is examining whether Autopilot ""may exacerbate human factors or behavioral safety risks.""  Tesla last year issued a remote software update to better detect emergency vehicles in low light. The update, issued to Tesla's fleet of internet-connected cars as a software update, drew NHTSA's attention after Tesla aimed to better equip the cars to detect emergency vehicles - without filing the requisite paperwork to inform regulators of the change.  Tesla has the ability to remotely issue software updates that change how its vehicles behave, sometimes patching safety issues in the process. But regulators' insistence that it must publicly spell out those changes has ushered in a spate of recent recalls, which led Musk to decry NHTSA as the ""fun police"" this year.  NHTSA's engineering analysis will examine 16 crashes, more than the 11 the agency had initially identified when it opened its probe last August - after officials identified additional incidents that fit the description during the course of their evaluation.

"Document WP00000020220521ei5l0002h","Style","Tesla documentary's key arguments","Ashley Fetters Maloy","1213 words","21 May 2022","The Washington Post","WP","FINAL","C04",NA,"English","Copyright 2022, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved","By now, everybody knows the two-pronged promise Tesla has been making for nearly a decade: The car company aims to revolutionize both cars' relationship to the environment (through gas-free electric power) and consumers' safety on the roads (through self-driving capabilities). Tesla CEO Elon Musk has long been fond of emphasizing that traffic deaths would decrease if driving weren't in the all-too-human hands of, well, the driver - and has promised that one day, traveling by car will be like taking an elevator. ""You'll tell it where you want to go, and it takes you there with extreme levels of safety.""  The cars are certainly electric. That second objective, a new documentary argues, has proved more elusive.","Informed by the reporting of the New York Times' Cade Metz and Neal Boudette, director Emma Schwartz's ""Elon Musk's Crash Course"" raises a skeptical eyebrow toward Tesla's vaunted Autopilot feature, sometimes described as its self-driving software. It maintains that Autopilot hasn't lived up to its promise and that lives have been endangered as a result. Here are three key arguments Schwartz's film puts forth.  1. Despite Tesla's claims that its technology would revolutionize cars for the safer, its cars have sometimes failed to recognize certain safety threats while in Autopilot mode - and Tesla drivers have had fatal road accidents while using it.  According to ""Elon Musk's Crash Course,"" an investigation in 2016 by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) found that some 38 Tesla crashes had taken place in the United States while the cars were in Autopilot mode, but the film details three in which drivers were killed.  The first is that of Josh Brown, a bomb dismantler for the Navy in the Iraq War and the founder of a company that aimed to extend Internet service into rural America. Described by his friends as a passionate tech enthusiast, Brown loved his Tesla and often filmed videos behind the wheel. When Musk retweeted one such video in April 2016, in which the car in Autopilot mode steered itself out of the way of a truck merging too aggressively, Brown was elated.  Brown was driving on the same mode through Williston, Fla., after leaving Disney World the following month when his Tesla drove under a tractor-trailer without slowing down. Brown, 40, was killed in the collision. (Despite rumors that Brown had been watching a movie, the documentary makes clear that no movies were found on Brown's laptop. Still, NHTSA and the National Transportation Safety Board, or NTSB, found that Brown was at fault because he was not paying attention to the road.) In the film, Musk is heard in an audio recording saying later that radar upgrades that were added to the Autopilot software after Brown's accident might have saved Brown's life.  In March 2018, 38-year-old Apple engineer Walter Huang died when his Tesla, running in Autopilot mode, hit a concrete barrier in Mountain View, Calif., at over 70 mph. Former NTSB chairman Robert L. Sumwalt says on-screen that Huang was found to have been playing a video game.  And in March 2019, Jeremy Banner, 50, was killed in another Florida highway accident, nearly identical to the one that killed Brown. The Tesla was on Autopilot when a tractor-trailer pulled across the road. Banner's car failed to recognize the side of the vehicle in the bright sunlight and went underneath it, shearing off the roof.  Sumwalt alleges in ""Crash Course"" that Tesla has ignored its safety recommendations after crashes. ""When innovation is implemented, we have to make sure it's done safely,"" he says, ""or it's going to be the Wild West out there.""  2. Some former engineers at Tesla privately harbored doubts about Musk's promises to the public about the Tesla's ability to self-drive.  Despite Musk's claims starting in 2015 that self-driving cars were essentially a ""solved problem"" and that the kinks were merely being worked out, multiple former staffers allege in ""Crash Course"" that wasn't the case behind closed doors.  They say, for example, that certain decisions were made somewhat arbitrarily - such as the decision to use cameras instead of a popular radar system known as lidar. ""There was no deep research phase where various vehicles were outfitted with a range of sensors. Many team members would have liked that,"" says Akshat Patel, Autopilot's engineering program manager from 2014 to 2015. ""Instead, the conclusion was made first, and the test and development activities began, to prove that conclusion correct.""  Others allege that they worried the Autopilot technology was being sold to and used by people who believed it would provide the same elevator-like transportation experience Musk had once described - drivers who believed they could get in, provide a destination, then sit back and relax. When Brown's crash happened, ""I was aware that people were trusting the system to do things that it was not designed or capable of doing,"" says JT Stukes, senior project engineer at Tesla from 2014 to 2018. ""The fact that that sort of accident happened is obviously tragic. But it was going to happen.""  Raven Jiang, an engineer who also worked on Autopilot at Tesla from 2015 to 2016, notes that in the same time frame, Elizabeth Holmes's transgressions at Theranos were being revealed to the public. ""Some of those stories were at the back of my mind,"" Jiang says. ""It definitely made me question a lot more about what's behind some of this public optimism.""  3. Tesla enjoys substantial public support anyway.  The most recent footage included in ""Crash Course"" comes from just last month. Musk, wearing a black cowboy hat and black aviators, grins onstage in front of a whooping, enraptured crowd at the launch party for Tesla's new Gigafactory in Austin. Partygoers hold their phones up to film him speaking - a stark reminder that Musk is a megacelebrity and a hero to many.  One Tesla owner, Alex Poulos, points out that Musk superfans sometimes call themselves ""Musketeers."" Kim Paquette, another Tesla owner who's part of an elite group that test-drives new versions of the self-driving software, shows off her collection of HotWheels-size Teslas and says she's ""honored"" to participate in the testing process. ""People who buy a Tesla understand that it's not self-driving yet,"" she says. Even Brown's family says that ""part of Joshua's legacy is that the accident [that caused his death] drove additional improvements, making the new technology even safer,"" in a statement read on their behalf at a building dedication for him. ""Our family takes solace and pride in the fact that our son is making such a positive impact on future highway safety.""  And yet, Poulos says, ""Full self-driving, that's what I paid for and I don't have it. It's right there in the name of it, right? And I don't think that's fair to say.  ""Musk, I think he has a huge responsibility,"" he adds. ""I think he needs to be a little bit more cautious about what he tells his followers.""

As he sets out to change a communication tool used by more than 200 million people, the question is: What will be different about his promises this time?  Here's a short history of promises that Musk never delivered or we're still waiting to arrive.  March 2016The Tesla Model 3 will cost $35,000  What he said: When Musk unveiled Tesla's Model 3 sedan, he said the standard model would cost $35,000.  What happened: Tesla did briefly sell the Model 3 for that price in 2019, but the low price never played the role Musk suggested in making electric vehicles common. Then, Tesla got rid of the $35,000 models entirely in 2020. Now Tesla lists the starting price of its rear-drive Standard Range Plus model at $46,990.  January 2017  Full self-driving Tesla cars ready in 6 months  What he said: Answering a question on Twitter about when ""full self-driving"" features would exceed ""enhanced autopilot"" features (like cruise control), Musk said: ""3 months maybe, 6 months definitely."" That was five years ago.  What happened: In September 2021, Tesla began letting select owners request ""full self-driving"" software upgrades. Video from beta testers revealed deep flaws.  March 2017  Brain implants  What he said: Musk revealed that he founded a company called Neuralink to connect brains to computers. It would enable people with spinal cord injuries to walk or eventually permit human-to-human telepathy, he suggested. In 2019, Musk predicted the technology would be implanted in a human skull by 2020.  What happened: Neuralink has implanted chips in the brains of a monkey and a pig, and in December 2021, Musk tweeted that ""progress will accelerate when we have devices in humans . . . next year."" But as of January, only two of the eight scientists Musk brought in to help him create Neuralink remain at the company.  July 2017  A tunnel will speed travel between New York and Washington  What he said: Musk founded the Boring Company to speed up digging tunnels that could be used for speedy transportation in busy urban corridors. ""Just received verbal govt approval for The Boring Company to build an underground NY-Phil-Balt-DC Hyperloop. NY-DC in 29 mins,"" Musk tweeted.  What happened: Today, the Hyperloop tunnel project between Washington and New York is no longer listed on the company's website. The company demonstrated a California test tunnel in 2018 and opened a 1.7-mile tunnel at the Las Vegas Convention Center in April 2021.  November 2017  A Tesla Semi truck will arrive by 2019  What he said : Musk announced a large truck with an ambitious range of 500 miles and an even more ambitious production timeline of 2019.  What happened : Tesla has taken Semi orders, and prototypes have been seen in testing, and Musk has now committed to delivering some in 2023.  July 2018  Musk offers a submarine to rescue soccer team trapped in a cave  What he said : When 12 soccer players trapped in a cave in Thailand made global headlines, Musk offered to help by developing a submarine to extract them. ""Mini-sub arriving in about 17 hours. Hopefully useful. If not, perhaps it will be in a future situation,"" he tweeted.  What happened : The boys were rescued by divers who carried them through the cave on stretchers and did not use Musk's submarine. Some rescuers said the tech wasn't practical.  April 2019  1 million robotaxis on the road by 2020  What he said : ""I feel very confident predicting autonomous robotaxis for Tesla next year,"" Musk said in 2019 at an investor event. (He also warned: ""Sometimes I am not on time, but I get it done."") He also predicted that within two years, Tesla would be making cars with no pedals or steering wheels.  What happened : Tesla's self-driving technology is still limited to tests with selected car owners, not autonomous taxis. In April 2022, Musk said that Tesla would build a vehicle dedicated for use as a robotaxi and that it will ""look quite futuristic.""  November 2019  Tesla Cybertruck to begin production in 2021  What he said: Musk unveiled a futuristic electric pickup with a steel ""exoskeleton"" and sharp angles. Production was supposed to begin in late 2021 with a release date in 2022.  What happened : During a demonstration of the strength of the car's new unbreakable windows, Musk asked one of the people onstage to try to break the glass - and it shattered. As of April, the Cybertruck's release has been pushed to 2023.  May 2020  Tesla workers told it's okay to stay home during covid-19  What he said: When Musk defied local covid-19 orders and reopened Tesla's factory in Fremont, Calif., he told employees they could stay home. If ""you feel uncomfortable coming back to work at this time, please do not feel obligated to do so,"" he wrote in an email.  What happened : Several employees said they received termination notices for ""failure to return to work"" after they took unpaid leave to protect themselves.  April 2022  Tesla's humanoid robot will be ready for production in 2023  What he said: In August 2021, Musk unveiled plans for a ""friendly"" humanoid robot called Optimus or Tesla Bot that could ""navigate through a world built for humans and eliminate dangerous, repetitive and boring tasks."" In April, Musk said, ""We have a shot of being in production for version one of Optimus hopefully next year.""  What happened: To date, Tesla has not shown a working prototype.

"Document WP00000020220328ei3s0001f","A-Section","How auto regulators played mind games with Elon Musk","Faiz Siddiqui","2094 words","28 March 2022","The Washington Post","WP","FINAL","A03",NA,"English","Copyright 2022, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved","SAN FRANCISCO - The first time Washington regulators tried to investigate Tesla's Autopilot software, CEO Elon Musk was irate.  Weeks earlier, a Tesla using the company's advanced driver-assistance system had crashed into a tractor-trailer at about 70 mph, killing the driver. When National Highway Traffic Safety Administration officials called Tesla executives to say they were launching an investigation, Musk screamed, protested and threatened to sue, said a former safety official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.","The regulators knew Musk could be impulsive and stubborn; they would need to show some spine to win his cooperation. So they waited. And in a subsequent call, ""when tempers were a little bit cool,"" the official said, Musk agreed to cooperate: ""He was a changed person.""  Since that success in 2016, officials have learned to work with Musk, using a combination of pressure, flattery and threats to persuade him to comply with federal safety measures, according to a half-dozen former regulators, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. In the past six months, Tesla has issued at least a dozen voluntary recalls, a dramatic turnaround for a company known to quietly issue software updates direct to cars - without alerting the public - to fix sometimes alarming safety problems.  With about 2 million cars on the road, Tesla recently has experienced a wave of troubles: Cars using its driver-assistance features have slammed on the brakes for no reason and rolled through stop signs - the latter because Tesla programmed them to do so. A string of crashes into parked emergency vehicles is under investigation. And the cars' batteries have been documented exploding in crashes and while parked in garages.  Such issues typically prompt NHTSA to investigate and sometimes to push for voluntary or mandatory recalls.  If an automaker refuses to cooperate, NHTSA can impose cash fines of about $23,000 per day. The threat of fines - which can add up to nearly $115 million - generally works with traditional companies, the former officials said, but hasn't proven effective when dealing with Tesla, an extraordinarily valuable company owned by the richest man in the world.  So NHTSA officials have turned to less conventional strategies to force the electric vehicle manufacturer to be more transparent about safety issues - a critical matter at a time when more than 50,000 drivers can now use Tesla's ""Full Self-Driving"" software to navigate the nation's public roads.  ""Tesla is presumably smart enough to realize when they don't have the upper hand anymore,"" said Phil Koopman, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University whose focus includes federal auto regulations. ""Tesla has a choice to make - they have to decide whether to cave or go to the mat. And the reality is, on [federal safety regulations] they're going to lose.""  Tesla and Musk did not respond to specific questions in a detailed request for comment. Musk said in an email, ""For the 100th time, please give my regards to your puppetmaster,"" referring to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who owns The Washington Post. In a subsequent email, he also criticized The Post's paywall for online articles.  NHTSA declined to make anyone available for an interview, citing ongoing investigations. But the agency issued written statements to The Post expressing its commitment to protect public safety.  Tesla has publicly touted the safety of its vehicles and its driver-assistance technology, boasting that it has won the highest possible score - five stars - in crash tests where NHTSA slams cars into barriers and then examines the results. Tesla also has said its cars have the lowest probability of injury of any car tested, though NHTSA has disputed that characterization.  Musk's own attitude was part of the problem with efforts to enforce safety, the officials said. Some experienced personal encounters with Musk that escalated into yelling matches or otherwise proved unproductive because of the CEO's skepticism about their findings.  NHTSA's experiences with Tesla were unique among major automakers, the officials said. It was not rare for companies under scrutiny to fiercely push back against their findings, sometimes resulting in mandatory rather than voluntary recalls, they said. But with Tesla, issues as simple as a malfunctioning heat pump or noncompliant sound effects to alert pedestrians to a vehicles' presence could result in stubbornness.  Tesla eventually issued recalls in both cases - decisions influenced by NHTSA, a spokeswoman said.  ""NHTSA will ensure that vehicle manufacturers and developers prioritize safety while they usher in the latest technologies,"" spokeswoman Lucia Sanchez said.  Regulators have been slow to take action on some software suites that power automated features, in part because they are wary of appearing to stifle emerging technologies, the former officials said. There also are few rules governing these technologies, further hindering efforts at regulation.  Since 2016, NHTSA has opened 31 special crash investigation cases involving advanced driver-assistance technology, according to data provided by the agency. Twenty-four have involved Tesla vehicles.  Safety experts and some of the former regulators who spoke with The Post raised concerns about ""Full Self-Driving"" in particular because of its experimental nature. Tesla says the software is in ""beta,"" meaning it is a pilot through which the company hopes to learn and improve its features for an eventual full release.  Lawmakers have pressed for more transparency regarding Tesla's practices. In February, following a Post report on the cars' sudden braking, Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) criticized Tesla for putting software on the roads ""without fully considering its risks and implications."" They urged NHTSA ""to continue taking all appropriate action to protect all users of the road."" And they called on the Federal Trade Commission to launch an investigation into what they called ""misleading advertising and marketing"" of Autopilot and ""Full Self-Driving"" systems.  During much of the Obama administration, Tesla slid under the radar of federal safety regulators. As a niche automaker delivering at most tens of thousands of luxury cars per year, officials said it would not have ranked on the agency's priority list, compared with high-volume automakers such as Ford and Toyota.  From 2013 to 2015, there was just one recall per year for early Tesla Model S luxury sedans. Those recalls - which involved seat back mountings, charging equipment and incorrectly secured seat belts - compare with a total of 2,261 vehicle recalls over the same period, according to NHTSA data.  One early run-in set the tone for regulators' interactions with Tesla. In 2013, Tesla claimed its Model S was the safest car ever tested by NHTSA.  Officials at the agency were dumbstruck, according to some of those who spoke with The Post. The agency issues up to 5-star ratings, but it does not take its designations beyond the star score.  At one point, two former officials recalled, NHTSA officials threatened to contact the FTC, which regulates marketing. ""If Tesla wasn't willing to pull the plug, FTC was probably going to take action,"" one of the former officials said.  Tesla backed down.  But Tesla continued to make similar claims, including in 2019, when it said its Model 3 had the ""lowest probability of injury of any vehicle ever tested"" by NHTSA. The agency ultimately referred the automaker to the FTC. The FTC declined to comment.  NHTSA, meanwhile, focused increasing attention on the automaker as it built more and more cars, launching the Model X SUV in 2015 and steadily growing its production in the buildup to the mass market-aimed Model 3. The agency also had to deal with emerging issues, such as fires caused by road debris striking the cars' underbodies, where the high-voltage battery is located. Musk wrote in a statement at the time that Tesla would introduce a fix to bring that risk ""down to virtually zero.""  One official recalled that regulators were confused by Musk's reluctance to address one battery-related issue. The only evident solution was to appeal to his sense of pride.  ""NHTSA staff backs Musk into a corner and challenges his ego and says, 'Wait, you can't solve this?' "" a former official said. ""And the next day he has a solution.""  The Trump administration was even less hands-on. The NHTSA website lists only one recall for the 2017 through 2020 Tesla Model 3, then the automaker's most popular model. Depending on the model year, there were up to eight recalls issued for the same car beginning May 25, 2021, after President Biden took office.  Under the Trump administration, career officials and top staff were reluctant to take a strong stance on a mounting catalogue of safety concerns, wary of appearing to target innovation and already under pressure from the president to ease regulations.  The officials said staffers were reluctant to take on a rapidly emerging automotive power with a massive public platform, worried they wouldn't have the backing of top officials if they received a browbeating from Musk.  ""My former staff felt they had nothing to do - twiddling their thumbs,"" one former official said. ""The professional staff - the career staff - wanted to do stuff either from a regulatory standpoint or investigation perspective"" but were stymied.  Musk praised NHTSA as ""great"" in April 2021.  Then, things changed.  Although Labor Secretary Marty Walsh recently met with Musk and took a factory tour in Texas, Axios reported, Musk has criticized President Biden for leaving Tesla out of major events. Musk also has parroted Republican barbs, joking at one point Biden was ""sleeping.""  Last summer, NHTSA began requiring companies such as Tesla to report on certain crashes involving automated features within one day of learning of the incident. Then in August, the agency launched an investigation into about a dozen crashes involving parked emergency vehicles while Autopilot was active. In a letter, it called out Tesla for pushing out a software update to help its cars better see emergency vehicles, without formally issuing a recall.  A surge of investigations, recalls and public admonitions has followed.  Former officials who spoke with The Post said Tesla's haphazard approach has grated on some NHTSA staff, and the enforcement reflects an attempt at a course correction.  ""The agency does hold a very firm line on [federal motor vehicle regulations], and I don't think any of us want to live in a world where the automakers do essential recalls without going through that process,"" said Bryan Thomas, who was communications director at NHTSA during the Obama administration. ""If the car's going to react differently at a stop sign tomorrow than it did today, you should know that as a driver.""  The former officials said that NHTSA is not singling out Tesla. Instead, they said the agency is using a calculated approach to try to force the combative automaker to recognize findings that can't be denied. That means picking targets - the seat belt chime, rolling stops, a windshield defroster - that may strike executives and even some owners as trivial. But those narrow targets offer an entree to larger issues that are not yet addressed by federal regulations, which often lag behind the latest software advances.  In February, NHTSA cracked down on a feature known as ""Boombox,"" which plays sounds that bystanders can hear - such as an ice cream truck jingle - but can drown out sounds that warn pedestrians of approaching vehicles. On Twitter, Musk decried the agency as the ""fun police.""  Federal safety investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board have also focused their attention on Tesla. Late last year, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy wrote a letter to Musk calling out the company's ""inaction"" on recommendations that would have added safeguards to the Autopilot system in response to the fatal 2016 crash with the tractor-trailer.  In a statement posted to its website at the time, Tesla called the death ""A Tragic Loss."" The company defended the performance of Autopilot across the tens of millions of miles it had logged and emphasized that drivers should be prepared to take control of the vehicle at any time.  In September, Homendy expressed her concern about Musk's approach to safety in an interview with The Post.  ""I think Elon Musk is an incredible innovator,"" she said, expressing hope for ""the ultimate success of [autonomous vehicle] technologies - which could save lives.""  But she also encouraged Musk to ""really prioritize safety for his company,"" adding: ""I don't want to see lives lost in the meantime.""

"Document WP00000020220218ei2i0002n","A-Section","Regulators probe Tesla 'phantom braking' issue","Faiz Siddiqui Jeremy B. Merrill","958 words","18 February 2022","The Washington Post","WP","FINAL","A16",NA,"English","Copyright 2022, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved","SAN FRANCISCO - The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is probing sudden unexpected braking in Tesla vehicles, the latest safety probe faced by the electric-vehicle maker.  The agency said it had received 354 complaints about the issue in nine months, in two models across multiple model years: the 2021 and 2022 Tesla Model 3 and Model Y. NHTSA said the preliminary evaluation will affect approximately 416,000 vehicles.","""The complaints allege that while utilizing the [advanced driver-assistance] features including adaptive cruise control, the vehicle unexpectedly applies its brakes while driving at highway speeds,"" the agency said. ""Complainants report that the rapid deceleration can occur without warning, at random, and often repeatedly in a single drive cycle.""  Tesla owners flooded NHTSA's website with hundreds of complaints of alleged ""phantom braking"" this month following a Washington Post report that noted a sharp uptick in the phenomenon. The issue, a glitch in the cars' forward collision warning and automatic emergency-braking systems, occurs when Tesla's vehicles suddenly slow down in response to falsely detected hazards.  Owners began complaining of the issue in larger numbers beginning in November, days after the automaker issued a recall of its ""Full Self-Driving"" software over a glitch that could lead to phantom braking. More broadly, the surge has followed Tesla's shift from a multi-sensor perception system combining cameras and radar to a camera-based system that relies on what the automaker calls ""Tesla Vision."" The spate of complaints included several common patterns as well as at least one report of an injury.  After The Post's article in early February, NHTSA received about 250 complaints about phantom braking during the following two weeks. That compared to 107 complaints in the previous three months - a steep surge of its own - and only 34 in the preceding 22 months.  Tesla, which disbanded its public relations department in 2020, did not respond to requests for comment. ""NHTSA will determine the scope and severity of the potential problem and fully assess the potential safety-related issues,"" said NHTSA spokeswoman Lucia Sanchez.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly defended the use of its automated features, calling its Autopilot driver assistance ""unequivocally safer"" than normal driving and decrying the ""fun police"" as the company faced multiple recalls in recent weeks - an apparent reference to federal regulators.  Complaints of phantom braking involving Tesla vehicles also far surpass those for other automakers that likewise have advanced driver assistance but largely rely on radar-equipped systems. The increase in complaints sheds light on the types of common scenarios in which owners report phantom braking. Among all the complaints, about a third of the sudden slowdowns occurred on two-lane roads or highways when, for example, an oncoming truck was approaching in the distance, according to a Post analysis.  ""It's when the traffic is coming towards me that it randomly throws on the brake,"" Sally Bergquist, of Alexander City, Ala., who experienced repeated sudden slowdowns on her 2021 Tesla Model S on drives to Birmingham, said in an interview. ""This random braking is really concerning to me.""  The NHTSA complaints are not individually verified by the agency - owners describe the issue they experience, and provide their vehicle identification number along with other identifying information when they send their report. Complaints to NHTSA can - as apparently occurred here - be more frequent as owners learn about the possibility of telling the government about safety problems with their car, so increases in complaints might not always be due to an increase in the rate of problems.  But the sheer number of complaints for Teslas related to phantom braking far outpaced those for other vehicle makes and models, indicating a known problem of growing prominence among the owner population.  The Post's analysis covered the 2019 Tesla Model 3 along with 2020 through 2022 Tesla Model Y and Model 3 vehicles.  Tesla has faced mounting pressure from NHTSA over Autopilot and its practice of issuing over-the-air software updates to remedy issues with its vehicles, without initiating the formal recall process. The agency is investigating the potential role of Autopilot in about a dozen crashes involving Teslas and parked emergency vehicles while the driver-assistance system was active. Tesla has issued a steady stream of recalls since October, when NHTSA publicly called out the company for its failure to issue a formal recall when it updated its cars to better detect emergency vehicles in low light.  Tesla is facing scrutiny from other regulators, who have trained a lens on Musk's leadership.  Tesla disclosed in its annual financial report, for example, that the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a subpoena Nov. 16 looking for information on the company's compliance with a settlement governing Musk's tweets. Musk and the company each faced $20 million fines, and Musk had to give up his chairmanship of Tesla's board, after a 2018 tweet where he said he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 a share. Musk's potentially market-moving tweets also had to be vetted by a securities lawyer.  But a letter from Musk's attorney Thursday accused the SEC of hounding the CEO and Tesla with ""endless, unfounded investigations.""  ""Without coming before this Court, it has been weaponizing the consent decree by using it to try to muzzle and harass Mr. Musk and Tesla, while ignoring its Court-ordered duty to remit the $40 million that it continues to hold while Tesla's shareholders continue to wait,"" wrote Musk attorney Alex Spiro, in a letter to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan.  The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

"Document WP00000020220211ei2b00012","A-Section","Still a rough road for 'Full Self-Driving'","Faiz Siddiqui Reed Albergotti","2644 words","11 February 2022","The Washington Post","WP","FINAL","A14",NA,"English","Copyright 2022, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved","SAN FRANCISCO - In one video, a Tesla tries to drive down some light-rail tracks. In another, a Tesla fails to stop for a pedestrian in a crosswalk. And at one point, the most advanced driver-assistance product available to consumers appears to slam into a bike lane bollard at 11 mph.  Each of these moments - captured on video by a Tesla owner and posted online - reveals a fundamental weakness in Tesla's ""Full Self-Driving"" technology, according to a panel of experts assembled by The Washington Post and asked to examine the videos. These are problems with no easy fix, the experts said, where patching one issue might introduce new complications, or where the nearly infinite array of possible real-life scenarios is simply too much for Tesla's algorithms to master.","The footage includes a scene in which a driver appears to be fighting for control with the advanced driver-assistance software, as well as clips showing cars failing to properly interpret critical road markings and signs and ordinary pedestrian behavior.  The Post selected six videos from a large array posted on YouTube and contacted the people who shot them to confirm their authenticity. The Post then recruited a half-dozen experts to conduct a frame-by-frame analysis.  The experts include academics who study self-driving vehicles; industry executives and technical staff who work in autonomousvehicle safety analysis; and self-driving-vehicle developers. None work in capacities that put them in competition with Tesla, and several said they did not fault Tesla for its approach. Two spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid angering Tesla, its fans or future clients.  Their analysis suggests that, as currently designed, Full SelfDriving (FSD) could be dangerous on public roadways, according to several of the experts. Some defects appear to plague multiple versions of Tesla's software, such as inability to recognize light-rail tracks: One video shows a driver shifting into reverse after traveling too far onto the tracks.  ""The video [footage] shows different scenarios where the automated driving system was not able to detect and/or cope with relevant features of its Operational Design Domain,"" or the conditions under which the system is expected to safely operate, said Nicola Croce, technical program manager at Deepen AI, which helps companies deploy driver-assistance and autonomous-driving systems. Tesla is not one of its clients.  Lapses within the design domain, Croce said, are ""considered a failure to follow the safety expectations.""  Tesla did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The company disbanded its public relations department in 2020 and does not typically answer media requests.  Several drivers who spoke to The Post about the videos defended the technology. While they acknowledged that miscues happen, they said were able to safely ""disengage"" the software before a more serious incident.  ""I'm not going to put anybody in danger. I'm mindful of the cars around me,"" said Chris, a driver from Fenton, Mich., who spoke on condition that he be identified only by his first name out of concern for his privacy.  Full Self-Driving is one of two driver-assistance technologies available on Teslas. The other is ""Autopilot,"" a system primarily designed for highway use with an attentive driver behind the wheel.  When using Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, drivers must agree to ""keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times"" and always ""maintain control and responsibility for your car,"" according to Tesla's website.  The company has fiercely defended the safety record of Autopilot, with chief executive Elon Musk calling it ""unequivocally safer"" than regular driving based on crash data. However, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating whether Autopilot played a role in about a dozen crashes involving parked emergency vehicles. Last fall, a California driver was charged with vehicular manslaughter after striking another vehicle while Autopilot was activated, killing two people.  But the company has staked its autonomy ambitions on FSD, which brings automated capabilities to city and residential streets. FSD is only available in the form of a software beta, a type of pilot that serves as an advanced testing stage before eventual wide release. Tesla recently said that nearly 60,000 vehicles in the United States are now equipped with it.  Full Self-Driving uses Tesla's suite of eight surround cameras to stitch together a view of the world outside the car. The images are fed into Tesla's software, which the company intends to leverage to help its vehicles learn. The cameras are supplemented by 12 ultrasonic sensors that detect objects around the vehicle.  Tesla has issued multiple recalls of the Full Self-Driving Beta, sending remote updates after the software raised concerns with federal auto safety regulators. In October, the company recalled the software for about 12,000 vehicles after an update led cars to begin braking abruptly at highway speeds. Tesla remotely issued a fix.  In late January, Tesla notified regulators it would update the Full Self-Driving Beta to eliminate a ""rolling stop"" function that allowed cars to proceed through stop signs without fully halting. Last week, The Post reported that owner complaints of unexpected braking, a phenomenon known as ""phantom braking,"" surged in the period after Tesla eliminated the use of radar to aid its vehicles' perception.  To further understand how the technology operates, The Post turned to videos showing the system in action. In interviews, most of the drivers who posted the videos said they did so to showcase the car's cutting-edge capabilities. The car's mistakes, they said, serve not as evidence of insurmountable limitations, but instead as mile markers to document progress.  Some drivers said they have run their own experiments to test and improve the software. Kevin Smith, who uses FSD on his Tesla Model Y in Murfreesboro, Tenn., said he identified 13 locations near his hometown that stumped his car and created a route that hit all of them. ""Each time, it gets a little bit better,"" he said.  While some experts in AI are critical of Tesla's decision to release Full Self-Driving before it's ready for the road, many say they appreciate the ability to analyze and learn from videos posted by Tesla drivers. Most show the screen in the car's center console, offering clues about how the software is interpreting data from the real world.  ""The value [of Tesla's experiment] to society, I think, is transparency,"" said Mohammad Musa, founder of Deepen AI.  ""Whatever you see from anyone else is what they want you to see,"" he said of Tesla's competitors. ""It might actually fire back at [Tesla] and become a PR nightmare. … For better or for worse, they are opening up about things.""  First recorded crash  On a clear day in early February, a Tesla in FSD Beta makes a right turn through a San Jose intersection at about 15 mph. A bike lane flanks the inner side of the road. Suddenly, the car approaches a set of green-and-white protective bollards at a sharp angle.  It slams into the first bollard after the crosswalk at about 11 mph.  The car suffered only minor scrapes, but FSD testers and experts who analyzed the video say it is the first publicly released footage of a crash involving the software. And it revealed flaws.  ""The bollard issue is both mapping and perception. As permanent bollards rather than temporary cones, they should be on a map,"" said Brad Templeton, a longtime self-driving-car developer and consultant who worked on Google's self-driving car. That way, he said, ""the car would know that nobody ever drives through these.""  ""As to why the perception missed them until too late, this is an issue with computer vision. Perhaps it never got trained on these unusually shaped and [colored] bollards,"" said Templeton, who owns a Tesla and has described himself as a ""fan.""  Tesla's ultrasonic sensors might be expected to detect such hazards, but their locations in places such as the front bumper can be a weakness. ""Sparse, thin things like posts may not be seen by these,"" Templeton said.  A pedestrian near miss  On an overcast December day in San Jose, one video shows a routine right turn at a green light leading to a close call with a pedestrian. Traveling at about 12 miles an hour, the Tesla is proceeding across light-rail tracks when a woman steps off the sidewalk and into the crosswalk.  The woman stops abruptly when she sees the Tesla heading toward her. The Tesla appears to slow down, but only after traveling through most of the crosswalk.  After analyzing the video and others like it, The Post's panel of experts said FSD does not appear to recognize pedestrian walk signs, or anticipate that a stationary pedestrian might venture into the street.  ""It's unclear whether the car reacted or not to [the pedestrian's] presence, but clearly the driver is shaken,"" said Andrew Maynard, a professor at Arizona State University, who is director of its Risk Innovation Lab.  The driver, who confirmed the veracity of the footage, declined to comment further.  Hod Finkelstein, chief research and development officer for AEye, a company that sells lidar technology to automakers, said he does not believe cameras alone are good enough to detect pedestrian intent in all conditions, in part because they aren't good at measuring the distance of faraway objects and can be blinded by car headlights and the sun. Traditional manufacturers of autonomous vehicles have used a combination of cameras, lidar, traditional radar and even ultrasonic sensors for close range.  That the Tesla keeps going after seeing a pedestrian near a crosswalk offers insight into the type of software Tesla uses, known as ""machine learning."" This type of software is capable of deciphering large sets of data and forming correlations that allow it, in essence, to learn on its own.  Tesla's software uses a combination of machine-learning software and simpler software ""rules,"" such as ""always stop at stop signs and red lights."" But as one researcher pointed out, machine-learning algorithms invariably learn lessons they shouldn't. It's possible that if the software were told to ""never hit pedestrians,"" it could take away the wrong lesson: that pedestrians will move out of the way if they are about to be hit, one expert said.  Software developers could create a ""rule"" that the car must slow down or stop for pedestrians. But that fix could paralyze the software in urban environments, where pedestrians are everywhere.  Maynard said that the early-February crash with a bollard may reveal characteristics of how Tesla's system learns.  ""[It] shows that FSD beta is still fazed by edge cases that it hasn't learned to navigate, yet most human drivers would handle with ease,"" he said. ""One question it raises is whether Tesla are teaching FSD by brute force - exposing the algorithms to every conceivable scenario - or whether they are teaching it to learn and problem solve like a human driver. The latter is what makes humans so adaptable on the road, and yet is exceptionally hard to emulate in a machine.""  Optical illusions  In another clip from early December recorded by the same driver, the Tesla appears to stop for a pedestrian crossing the road outside a crosswalk. The Tesla begins to stop long before the pedestrian approaches the curb. Many human drivers would have kept on driving.  The video suggests Teslas may be programmed to slow down for pedestrians if they are moving in the direction of the road, the experts said. But one expert suggested another possibility: The car may have stopped because of an optical illusion.  A red sign between the Tesla and the pedestrian briefly lines up with a tree on the sidewalk, for a moment creating an image generally resembling a stop sign. A later video uploaded in February demonstrated the same phenomenon, suggesting the stop sign illusion was indeed tricking the car.  Were Tesla's software to be confused by a phantom stop sign, that would highlight a key difference with many of its competitors, which use detailed maps showing the precise location of stop signs and other obstacles and road markings.  Struggle for control  In another instance, the same Tesla is passing a UPS truck stopped on a narrow street with parked vehicles on either side. Unsure what to do, the car's software prompts the driver to take over. But the driver struggles to gain control of the vehicle, swinging the steering wheel dramatically from side to side.  ""I am taking over,"" the driver says, as the wheel turns erratically. ""I'm - I'm trying.""  Experts say the incident illustrates a fundamental challenge with Tesla's decision to release software that requires regular intervention by humans. Other companies have bypassed this stage, instead releasing cars that aim to do away with the human driver entirely.  In the case of the UPS truck, both the computer system and the human were attempting to drive the car through a tight spot with very little wiggle room to the left or right. In most cases, the driver takes over by yanking the steering wheel in the opposite direction the software is trying to turn. That movement wasn't possible under these circumstances, however, leaving it unclear whether the car or the human was in control. The struggle for control was amplified by the lack of a sharp turn, preventing the driver from cranking the wheel to regain his steering input from the software.  ""It's unclear who exactly is in control at that moment,"" Maynard said. ""There's an odd glitch here where there seems to be a short fight for control between the driver and the car. It appears there are scenarios where both driver and car potentially lose control at some points.""  Maynard called the incident an ""important"" moment that reveals a glitch not in the car's judgment, ""but in the ability of the human driver to ensure safety.""  Learning to read  Another video The Post analyzed was posted in November by Chris, the Fenton, Mich., driver. The video shows the car failing to react to a ""Stop here on red"" sign, forcing Chris to apply the brakes.  An autonomous-driving researcher said such signs, which are ubiquitous on American roadways, can create vexing problems for Tesla engineers. Unless the car's cameras recognize the letters on the sign, the computer would have to look for other clues, like an arrow or a thin white line painted across the road. But that could create problems in other scenarios, prompting the car to stop erroneously when it sees a line on the road or a similar-looking arrow.  Many of Tesla's competitors use high-definition maps to take the guesswork out of where to stop and turn, the experts said. But that strategy raises other issues, including whether any map can keep pace with precise conditions on the nation's ever-changing network of roads.  ""Most of the problems here are solved if you have maps,"" Templeton said. ""If you use maps, you can drive decently in your service area,"" he wrote in an email to The Post. ""Without maps, you can crash on any street in the country.""  After driving with FSD for about a year, Chris said he thinks it will be a decade before the cars can reliably drive themselves.  The experts who spoke with The Post agreed with that timeline.  ""The last mile of safety is really the hardest part,"" said Musa. ""It's like launching aviation in the early 1900s: They didn't get the first plane right in the first go. They just kept improving every time something bad happens.""

"Document WP00000020220206ei2600004","Outlook","Companies are still racing to make self-driving cars. But why?","David Zipper","2270 words","6 February 2022","The Washington Post","WP","FINAL","B01",NA,"English","Copyright 2022, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved","The buzz is back for self-driving cars. Not long ago, blown forecasts left investors and tech enthusiasts feeling deflated: In 2016, Ford planned to offer self-driving taxis by 2021, and Lyft claimed it would start doing so even earlier.  But such unfulfilled promises now lie in the rearview mirror. ""It's beginning to feel like 2016 again,"" Axios proclaimed last month. During the CES electronics show in January, General Motors, Chinese automaker Geely and autonomous-vehicle developer Mobileye all promised that individuals would be able to buy their own self-driving cars this decade, potentially as soon as 2024.","If that happened - emphasis on the ""if"" - it would be groundbreaking. Right now, there are no self-driving cars available for public purchase (even if Tesla misleadingly calls its driver assistance system ""Full Self-Driving""). But if and when autonomous vehicles finally arrive en masse, should we cheer, or should we worry? It's a good time to ask an even more fundamental question: What exactly is the point of self-driving cars? The answer, despite more than $100 billion in investment over the last decade, according to McKinsey, remains surprisingly nebulous. And that should trouble us - a lot.  One hundred and 20 years ago, early adopters of ""horseless carriages"" - what we now call automobiles - were often affluent men who flocked to the vehicles as a futuristic, high-tech form of entertainment. But it didn't take long for their potential societal value to become clear, especially in urban areas.  At the time, American streets were filled with horses that required stables and regular feeding, and that left pavement covered in smelly waste. (Horses deposited about 1 million pounds of fresh manure on New York City streets every day, according to Christopher Wells's book ""Car Country."") Cars replaced these messy animals and also allowed cities to spread out, mitigating dangerous overcrowding. While their drawbacks, like smog and traffic deaths, were substantial, automobiles offered real chances for advancement.  Like cars, autonomous vehicles were born not from public need but from technological opportunity. Phil Koopman, an engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University who has worked on autonomous technology for more than 25 years, saw classmates developing prototypes that lumbered through Carnegie Mellon's campus when he was a doctoral student in the late 1980s. ""They weren't solving a societal problem,"" he says. ""They were solving the 'It would be cool if we could get cars to drive themselves' problem.""  Early tinkerers didn't focus too much on the eventual applications of self-driving technology, but the military did. Specifically, autonomous vehicles offered a chance to limit risk among men and women in uniform - a tantalizing possibility, especially in the wake of the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) organized the first Grand Challenge for autonomous vehicles in 2004 in the Mojave Desert, offering a prize of $1 million to the team whose machine first completed the 150-mile test track. No entrant came close: The farthest any vehicle got was just over seven miles. But the competition captured the imagination of the private sector, even though no one was sure what the civilian purpose of a self-driving car might be.  Enter Google. In 2007 the company hired Sebastian Thrun, leader of the Stanford team that won the second DARPA Grand Challenge, to launch a new self-driving-car initiative that would later form the basis of the company known as Waymo. Planning to deploy its technology on public roads, Google claimed that the rationale for self-driving cars was safety. In a 2010 corporate blog post, the company zeroed in on the 1.2 million annual traffic fatalities worldwide. ""We believe our technology has the potential to cut that number, perhaps by as much as half,"" Google claimed. It was quite a vision - and one whose appeal seemed unassailable from the political right or left. Other AV players followed Google's lead, pointing to safety as the raison d'etre for their own self-driving cars.  In 2015 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration offered those claims a tail wind when it published a memo stating that human error (along with other factors, such as flawed road engineering or dangerous car design) played a role in 94 percent of traffic collisions. Later, NHTSA's nuanced finding was often boiled down to ""94 percent of crashes are caused by human error"" (a misinterpretation that the Utah Department of Transportation calls a ""staggering fact""). Recognizing a windfall when they saw it, automakers and AV companies placed that 94 percent figure at the center of their marketing pitches.  Unfortunately, the potential safety benefits of self-driving cars are probably overblown. For one thing, many other problems cause crashes besides human error, such as confusing intersections and the blind spots of tall SUVs. But even with that significant caveat aside, it's unclear whether an autonomous driving system will ultimately be safer than a person behind the wheel.  While self-driving cars won't drive drunk or sleepy, the limitations of their machine learning will inevitably lead to mistakes that human drivers wouldn't make. As an example, Koopman recalls a self-driving system a few years ago that struggled to identify the color yellow. ""The system was missing bicyclists in yellow coats and construction workers in yellow jackets,"" he says. ""The system was 99 percent accurate - and it still missed them.""  Koopman believes that the safety hype around AVs is exaggerated. ""There's nothing I've seen showing whether AVs will be safer than humans in the short to medium term,"" he says. ""Machine learning is brittle, and it struggles with things it hasn't seen before."" Especially in cities, seeing something unprecedented - like a woman chasing a duck with a broom, a scene a Google car apparently encountered - is quite common. (Notably, self-driving trucks on highways may be more viable than self-driving cars in cities because of the simpler road environment.) And system errors have already proved deadly: A prototype AV from Uber struck and killed Elaine Herzberg while she walked her bicycle across an avenue in Tempe, Ariz., in 2018. Afterward, Arizona's governor suspended Uber's ability to test its autonomous technology there, and two years later, the company sold its self-driving unit to Aurora, a start-up.  Further complicating safety arguments is the question of whether car companies would design autonomous vehicles to break traffic laws. Until the federal government forced a recall on Tuesday, Tesla's Full-Self Driving system allowed cars to automatically do illegal ""rolling stops"" instead of coming to a complete halt.  If road safety is the goal, there are already plenty of available technologies that automakers could invest in, rather than leapfrogging to fully autonomous vehicles. Take advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS), such as automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection. Such features have already been shown to save lives, but their capabilities vary wildly from one model to another - assuming they're available at all. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, automatic emergency braking wasn't installed on 57 percent of the vehicles produced by Stellantis or 42 percent of those from GM during the 12 months ending last Aug. 31. Improving and standardizing ADAS is relatively low-hanging fruit compared with building self-driving cars, with more assured safety benefits.  Other proposed upsides of self-driving cars are also suspect. Will they boost productivity, allowing employees to take work calls and file memos from the road? That seems unlikely: One study concluded that only 1 in 4 drivers even wants to work during their commute. Could they free up space currently allocated to on-street parking? Maybe - though Amsterdam and Paris have shown that cities can do that without relying on autonomous vehicles. Will they expand transportation options for those who are vision- or mobility-impaired? Possibly in rural areas, but in cities and suburbs, people can already call a taxi or hail an Uber.  And then there's the argument that autonomous vehicles can help fight climate change. Tara Andringa, the executive director of Partners for Automated Vehicle Education (PAVE), a national coalition educating the public about AVs, says the technology could provide sustainability benefits, ""if we ensure that AV tech is limiting fossil fuels and that we are moving away from a system where each person has their own car."" Liberation from car dependence is part of the appeal of ""robotaxis"" and autonomous shuttles. Unfortunately, little evidence supports it. Rather than share self-driving rides, studies suggest that people want to travel in their own car, alone (which is consistent with companies' struggles to make pooled ride hail profitable). Automakers have noticed; General Motors, for example, seems to be shifting away from a vision of shared autonomous rides toward one of personal car ownership.  That pivot should sound alarms for those concerned about climate change or the future of cities. While self-driving cars have advanced far beyond the playthings that Koopman encountered at Carnegie Mellon 30 years ago, their societal benefits remain speculative at best. Meanwhile their downsides are very, very real - especially if they become widely available to purchase.  To understand why, consider an experiment in Northern California a few years ago, in which 13 people were given a chauffeur to take them anywhere they wanted for a week, effectively replicating the experience of having their own autonomous vehicle. Freed from the hassles of driving, test subjects traveled a whopping 83 percent more miles than when they had to drive themselves.  A concept called the Jevons paradox explains what happened: When a thing becomes cheaper, people discover new ways to use it. Self-driving cars reduce the ""cost"" of driving - in terms of effort, if not dollars - and as a result, they will induce people to take trips that they would have otherwise foregone. Over time, people with self-driving cars could opt to move farther from the central city, worsening sprawl and leading to still more miles driven.  Even if self-driving cars are electric, those added miles would be disastrous for the environment. Whether powered by batteries or gasoline, all cars produce emissions from brake dust as well as from friction between tires and pavement. And manufacturing EVs and charging batteries both require power and materials, expanding vehicles' total carbon footprint. If we're serious about addressing climate change, promoting transit and cycling instead of driving offers greater potential than any kind of automobile technology, autonomous or electric or otherwise.  For cities, the new driving spurred by AVs would be even more ominous. Without some sort of restrictive policy like a vehicle-miles-traveled tax or decongestion pricing, overwhelmed streets could become mired in gridlock, particularly if owners of self-driving cars avoided parking fees by instructing their vehicles to circle nearby streets while they grabbed a sandwich or met with a client.  These are troubling arguments against self-driving cars, especially when placed against their dubious benefits. But when boosters need a trump card, they can always point to China. When Sens. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) and John Thune (R-S.D.) introduced legislation supporting autonomous vehicles last year, they warned that ""the United States risks losing its technological leadership in the autonomous vehicle industry … unless it enacts policies to protect its leadership against the People's Republic of China.""  But does it really matter if China takes the lead in this realm? Global competition alone seems like insufficient justification to allow unfettered civilian use of a technology that could diminish American quality of life. After all, do the Chinese look with envy at American gunmakers like Smith & Wesson and Ruger, worrying that China's strict gun control and lack of a domestic firearms market hinders them on the world stage?  With so much at stake in the future of self-driving cars, government officials should be keeping a watchful eye on new developments, ready to intervene to defend the public interest. Some do seem to assume that posture. Speaking at CES last month, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said that self-driving cars have ""raised complicated, even philosophical, questions about safety, equity and our workforce."" But public officials often seem more eager to catalyze the arrival of AVs than to protect cities and citizens - and the planet - from their risks. In 2017, the House of Representatives passed the Self Drive Act, whose goal was ""encouraging"" the deployment of autonomous vehicles; that bill died in the Senate. Last year, the Senate considered Peters and Thune's measure, which would have allowed the carmakers to request that up to 80,000 self-driving cars per year be exempt from established automotive safety rules.  Politicians' support will come as a relief to the carmakers and tech companies whose market valuations rely on an expectation of widespread autonomous vehicle adoption. Companies can't scale self-driving cars if state and federal regulators refuse to bend rules, such as requiring a driver to be behind the wheel.  It's understandable that companies want to maximize shareholder return; that's their role in a market economy. But automakers are still struggling to explain why, exactly, we should be excited about this technology, rather than alarmed by it. We shouldn't let them off the hook unless we have a convincing answer.

"Document WP00000020220203ei230000h","A-Section","Tesla drivers report a surge in 'phantom braking' to false-alarm hazards","Faiz Siddiqui Jeremy B. Merrill","1399 words","3 February 2022","The Washington Post","WP","FINAL","A18",NA,"English","Copyright 2022, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved","SAN FRANCISCO - Teslas are unexpectedly slamming on their brakes in response to imagined hazards - such as oncoming traffic on two-lane roads - which has prompted their terrified owners to lodge a surge of complaints with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration over the past three months, according to a Washington Post analysis of federal auto safety data.  The phenomenon, known as ""phantom braking,"" has been a persistent issue for Tesla vehicles.","The automaker was forced to recall a version of its Full Self-Driving software in October over false positives to its automatic emergency-braking system that it said were triggered by the software update. Complaints soared after the recall and remain elevated, signaling continued owner concern.  Owner reports of phantom braking to NHTSA rose to 107 complaints in the past three months, compared with 34 in the preceding 22 months.  In addition to the safety recall in late October, the timing of the complaints coincides with a period in which Tesla has stopped using radar sensors in its vehicles to supplement the suite of cameras that perceive their surroundings. Tesla announced last year that it would stop equipping Tesla Model Y and Model 3 vehicles built in North America with radar beginning in May 2021. Tesla's new approach is known as ""Tesla Vision.""  Tesla vehicles are equipped with eight surround-view cameras that the automaker says ""provide 360 degrees of visibility around the car at up to 250 meters of range."" It also leverages 12 ultrasonic sensors to detect objects around the vehicle. Tesla eventually wants to transition its fleet to Tesla Vision, and some owners have been left wondering whether their cars' radar sensors will be disabled.  Drivers and safety experts said they believe the systems began acting erratically after the changes.  Several of the owners who filed complaints with regulators said their cars seemed overly sensitive to trucks in the opposite lane. One owner described how around noon on a straight road, the car lurched from 50 mph to a near-stop seemingly in response to a large truck.  ""[It] was scary to almost stop in the middle of my lane,"" the owner wrote.  ""Phantom braking is what happens when the developers do not set the decision threshold properly for deciding when something is there versus a false alarm,"" said Phil Koopman, a Carnegie Mellon University professor who focuses on autonomous vehicle safety. ""What other companies do is they use multiple different sensors and they cross-check between them - not only multiple cameras, but multiple types of sensors,"" such as radar and lidar, a type of sophisticated sensor that uses laser lights to paint a dot matrix mapping the environment.  ""With only one sensor type, it's harder to be sure because you do not have the cross-check from a different type of sensor,"" he said.  The NHTSA complaints are not individually verified by the agency. Owners submit their description of the issue, their vehicle identification number and other identifying information when they report their problems to the agency. NHTSA spokeswoman Lucia Sanchez said the agency is engaging in a dialogue with Tesla over the phantom braking reports.  ""NHTSA is aware of complaints received about forward collision avoidance and is reviewing them through our risk-based evaluation process,"" she said. ""This process includes discussions with the manufacturer, as well as reviewing additional data sources, including Early Warning Reporting data. If the data show that a risk may exist, NHTSA will act immediately.""  Tesla, which disbanded its public relations department in 2020, did not respond to a request for comment. The automaker has contended in the past that its driver-assistance feature suite, Autopilot, is safer than typical driving when crash data is compared. Autopilot is a system primarily intended for highway use, so the data cannot be directly compared with vehicle crashes overall. Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, has called Autopilot ""unequivocally safer.""  But the company faces mounting scrutiny from regulators, including recalls and safety investigations that called into question the responsibility and performance of its driver-assistance approach.  Tesla initiated a safety recall of its Full Self-Driving driver-assistance software late last month because of a feature than enabled it to conduct ""rolling stops,"" proceeding through intersections with stop signs without fully halting. Tesla had met with NHTSA officials twice in January to discuss the issue, part of growing safety concerns about the cars' automation-targeted software. NHTSA opened a safety investigation in August over about a dozen reports of crashes with parked emergency vehicles while Autopilot was activated.  The Post analysis covered more than a year of data for Tesla vehicles from the four most recent model years.  Owners of the 2022 Tesla Model 3 complained 20 times about the issue known as phantom braking, where the car suddenly slows or stops with no external cause, out of 22 total complaints involving the model.  The events are typically triggered by false positives of the forward collision warning and automatic emergency-braking systems. Owners often cited their use of Tesla's Autopilot driver-assistance system or traffic-aware cruise control in their complaints. They also commonly referred to issues on two-lane highways, where the system was triggered by an oncoming truck in the opposite lane.  The bulk of the complaints recently about Tesla cars have been related to the phantom braking issue - 107, or 57 percent, out of 189 complaints since November about the 2020 through 2022 Tesla Model Y and Model 3, along with the 2019 Tesla Model 3.  Some drivers recalled instances of phantom braking even when they were not using Autopilot. Other owners said in complaints to NHTSA that they were shaken by the incidents and feared being rear-ended.  ""These events are hair raising for me and passengers, let alone for a driver behind me,"" one owner wrote in a report to the agency. ""If he/she does not pay attention at that very moment, the result could even be disastrous. I would never have expected such a serious safety issue with a Tesla.""  Owners also said they experienced the phenomenon one or multiple times while on extended trips. Some said their road trip experiences were marred by the brakes suddenly triggering or the frequency jolts made by their cars.  ""My wife has requested that I don't use cruise control or autopilot while she's in the car, as we experienced an unwarranted, aggressive automatic braking episode which caused great pressure against her pregnant belly on a previous road trip,"" one owner said in a report.  Owners' comments reflected apparent exasperation with the recurrence of the problem and a seeming inability to get it fixed.  ""[These] things are happening with NOTHING present in front of my vehicle, and sometimes with nothing around me at all,"" one wrote.  Luis Fernandez, who drives a 2022 Tesla Model Y, said he was at Taylor Street and Pine Street in San Francisco recently when his car spotted a plastic bag several feet in front of him. The bag didn't pose a hazard and was soon out of his view, said Fernandez, who uses the vehicle to drive for Uber.  But his car jolted him from 25 mph to 15 mph before he could intervene.  ""Suddenly the car kind of locked, but it immediately released because the plastic bag moved away. . . . The car just completely took precaution,"" he said. ""Automatically, it braked.""  A 2021 Tesla Model Y owner, Ben Morris, confirmed that he was one of the people who filed a complaint with NHTSA. He said this was his third Tesla, and the issues presented themselves more than ever before on his other models.  ""We primarily drove the car on two-lane highways, which is where the issues would show themselves consistently,"" he said in an email. ""Although my 2017 Model X has phantom braked before, it is very rare, the vision-based system released May 2021 is night and day. We were seeing this behavior every day.""  He recalled an instance when his wife was driving at highway speeds of 55 to 60 mph and ""it slammed on the brakes hard, sending our children's booster seats slamming into the front seats.""  Thankfully, he said, the children weren't in the car.  Chris Alcantara contributed to this report.

All Rights Reserved","SAN FRANCISCO - Tesla will no longer allow drivers and front-seat passengers to play video games while its cars are in motion, the company told federal regulators after a probe was opened this week.  ""Tesla informed the agency that it is changing the functionality of this feature,"" Lucia Sanchez, a spokeswoman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said. ""In a new software update, 'Passenger Play' will now be locked and unusable when the vehicle is in motion.""","Sanchez said Tesla's move followed the opening of a preliminary evaluation into the feature on Tuesday, which allowed drivers and passengers to play solitaire and more advanced games while the car was moving by simply agreeing to a prompt that the software was for passenger use.  ""The Vehicle Safety Act prohibits manufacturers from selling vehicles with defects posing unreasonable risks to safety, including technologies that distract drivers from driving safely,"" Sanchez said.  She said the evaluation continues while federal regulators gather additional information from Tesla.  Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Washington Post. The company in the past has touted potential safety benefits of its advanced driver-assistance system, Autopilot, comparing its performance to driving overall.  But federal regulators worry that in-car distractions paired with systems that introduce automation will encourage drivers to take their eyes off the road. And Autopilot's performance is not directly comparable to regular driving because the system consists of primarily highway-only features.  A second system, called Full Self-Driving, is a software beta available to limited group of thousands of testers - and is intended to be used on city and residential streets.  NHTSA opened a probe this summer into Autopilot over crashes involving a dozen parked emergency vehicles while the system was activated. The agency also asked Tesla and other carmakers, along with manufacturers of self-driving vehicles, to report on any crashes involving autonomous and advanced-driver assistance systems within a day of learning of the incidents.  Sanchez said this week that NHTSA had opened its 580,000-vehicle probe into in-car gaming because of concerns about driver distraction.  ""NHTSA based its decision on reports that Tesla's gameplay functionality is visible from the driver's seat and can be enabled while driving the vehicle,"" she said, noting that ""no commercially available motor vehicles today can drive themselves.""  faiz.siddiqui@washpost.com   CT 	 http://www.washingtonpost.com[http://www.washingtonpost.com]  RF 	 WP20211224Tesla1224  CO 	 nathg : National Highway Traffic Safety Administration | teslmi : Tesla, Inc.

All Rights Reserved","SAN FRANCISCO - For a few hours late last month, Tesla cars began behaving erratically after receiving an overnight software update. Cars suddenly started slamming on the brakes at highway speeds, owners reported, risking collisions. CEO Elon Musk took to Twitter to acknowledge a problem with the software and vow that the update was being rolled back.  Ordinarily, that would have been the end of it for Musk, whose company has often flouted standard regulatory practices. But late last month, Tesla unexpectedly reported the glitch to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and issued an official recall notice detailing the problem, which may have affected nearly 12,000 vehicles.","Tesla's decision comes as the Biden administration has stepped up enforcement of federal safety regulations regarding advanced driver-assistance systems - particularly Tesla's habit of issuing software fixes without reporting underlying problems. Last month, NHTSA publicly dinged Tesla for failing to issue a formal recall when it issued a separate software update that enabled its cars to better detect parked emergency vehicles in low light. The update followed around a dozen prior crashes involving parked emergency vehicles while a system called Autopilot was activated.  It wasn't an isolated instance of criticism for the electric carmaker.  The National Transportation Safety Board, which has investigated multiple crashes involving Tesla's Autopilot software, has publicly called out the automaker over its failure to follow up on its safety recommendations. NHTSA, the top federal auto safety regulator, is investigating the Autopilot software itself - bringing potential regulatory authority to the equation. Musk has taken aim at federal regulators, but they haven't budged. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said recently the CEO was free to take up his concerns directly with him.  Longtime auto-industry observers and safety experts say Tesla is getting the message, even if Musk continues to be combative. The repeated incidents have potential financial and legal ramifications for Tesla, they said.  ""Inside Tesla, there has been a shift,"" said John Rosevear, senior auto analyst at the Motley Fool. Employees are concerned that ""'we're exposing ourselves here and we need to maybe get more serious about this,'"" he added.  Tesla, which has disbanded its public relations department, did not respond to a request for comment. The company has argued in the past that using Autopilot is safer than normal driving, based on comparisons of crash data. Musk has called Autopilot ""unequivocally safer."" Upon confirming the rollback of capabilities the company calls Full Self-Driving, he said occasional issues are ""to be expected with beta software,"" which is intended to be tested in a variety of conditions to iron out problems.  Company officials pledged to work with NHTSA in a recent earnings call, saying Tesla embraced the scrutiny on its software.  The official recall notice marks a sharp departure from Tesla's more typical mode of operation, in which it acts like its Silicon Valley neighbors to send update after update to the software that powers its products, making fixes in real time.  But Tesla vehicles are also being beta-tested in real time on the road - and the latest updates highlight the heightened dangers that come with putting software that is still a work in progress in the hands of drivers.  Full Self-Driving is the latest iteration of the company's software, now in the hands of roughly 12,000 drivers who paid as much as $10,000 to upgrade and received early access or passed a safety screening. It adds capabilities to navigate city and residential streets, with an attentive owner behind the wheel at all times. The features are not autonomous by regulatory and industry standards.  But already drivers have been reporting issues. Videos uploaded to social media show the software struggling to navigate roundabouts, veering toward pedestrians and even abruptly turning toward oncoming traffic.  Even Musk acknowledged in July that the software - which began its rollout to users a year ago - was a ""debatable"" proposition for potential subscribers.  The company's less advanced version of the software, dubbed Autopilot, is standard on Tesla vehicles. The software can navigate highways from on-ramps to off-ramps, and can also steer within marked lanes.  Things started escalating when NHTSA announced over the summer it would begin requiring Tesla and other manufacturers to report on incidents involving advanced driver-assistance systems, such as Autopilot. And in August, the agency launched a formal probe of Autopilot after nearly a dozen crashes involving parked emergency vehicles.  One of Tesla's latest run-ins with NHTSA came in October, after Tesla didn't notify officials of the emergency vehicle software update in September. It issued the update shortly after the government opened a probe into Tesla collisions with emergency vehicles.  NHTSA notified Tesla that such an action would typically be initiated through the federally established recall process, intended to remedy urgent safety risks through a combination of manufacturer expertise and government oversight.  ""Any manufacturer issuing an over-the-air update that mitigates a defect that poses an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety is required to timely file an accompanying recall notice to NHTSA,"" an agency official wrote in the Oct. 12 letter.  The agency also issued a letter in October raising concerns about another practice: requiring Full Self-Driving beta testers to sign a nondisclosure agreement prohibiting them from sharing certain information about the software beta. The agency noted it relies on the feedback from the public to learn of potential safety issues.  Tesla did away with the agreement, according to Musk, who compared it to toilet paper.  Kevin Smith, of Murfreesboro, Tenn., drives a Tesla Model Y and is part of the beta test. On Oct. 24, he hoped to test out the latest update but instead was locked out of the system, he said. And as he tried to get it to work, he heard from a fellow beta tester.  ""He was screaming 'Do not use it! Do not use it!'"" Smith said. ""'We are trying to wake up the folks at Tesla, trying to get the word to Tesla.'""  One of Smith's fellow testers shared a video showing one of the emergency-braking events - including ""a pretty dramatic slamming of the brakes,"" he recalled. ""For that to trigger undesirably at high speeds is an incredibly dangerous event.""  Smith noticed later that day Tesla had also remotely disabled his auto emergency braking and forward collision warning functions, safety features that he would ordinarily keep activated. And they hadn't let him know.  ""Dear @elonmusk, are you in there crossing the streams? I didn't change this brah,"" he wrote in a tweet. ""This isn't ok without any communication. Communication is not hard. I'm doing it now. Please advise.""  By the following day, NHTSA had asked Tesla for more information about the incident, according to NHTSA spokeswoman Lucia Sanchez.  Auto safety experts say Tesla's tweaks to safety features - without any notice to owners - were an unprecedented violation of trust. And it was exactly the type of behavior that had triggered the attention of federal auto safety regulators in the past.  Carnegie Mellon University professor Philip Koopman, who focuses on autonomous-vehicle safety, described it as ""incredible - not in a good way.""  ""If you're testing, you need to know if they're changing your vehicle out from under you,"" he said. ""Just taking that away and not making it super super obvious to drivers that that's happened is extremely concerning.""  Tesla submitted its recall notice on Oct. 29. In the bulletin, the company detailed why corrective action was necessary. It was the first time many drivers learned of what actually happened. That document, which confirmed what Tesla called the ""false-positive braking"" and accompanying warning chimes experienced by drivers, detailed the sequence of events that resulted from the buggy software update.  ""Tesla began to receive reports of false [forward collision warning] and [automatic emergency braking] events from customers,"" it wrote. ""In a matter of hours, we investigated the reports and took actions to mitigate any potential safety risk. This included cancelling [the update] on vehicles that had not installed it, disabling FCW and AEB on affected vehicles, and/or reverting software to the nearest available version.""  Tesla also laid out the risk to owners. ""If the AEB system unexpectedly activates while driving, the risk of a rear-end collision from a following vehicle may increase,"" it wrote.  Safety experts say it appears Tesla issued the recall because of the mounting regulatory pressure. NHTSA's Sanchez declined to say whether the recall came at federal safety regulators' urging. ""NHTSA will continue its conversations with Tesla to ensure that any safety defect is promptly acknowledged and addressed,"" she said.  Publicly, Musk has reacted to the increased regulatory attention. He's taken aim on Twitter at the Biden administration and federal auto safety appointees from both the NTSB and NHTSA.  He lashed out last month after NHTSA appointed Duke University professor Missy Cummings, who has been critical of Tesla's Autopilot and autonomous ambitions, as senior safety adviser.  In a tweet, he called her track record ""biased."" Tesla-supporting Twitter users swarmed her account, attacking her record. Buttigieg defended the appointment and invited Musk to raise his concerns with him directly, according to news reports.  NHTSA declined to make Cummings available for an interview.  NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy recently spoke with The Post and other publications, publicly scolding Tesla for rolling out new features without addressing prior recommendations about Autopilot. Those included instituting better driver monitoring and implementing safeguards to make sure it is used in the conditions for which it is intended.  Musk tweeted her Wikipedia page soon after. His followers also went after her.  Over the weekend, Musk reacted to a different type of government attention: a U.S. Senate proposal to institute a billionaire's tax that would target unrealized gains of the richest Americans. He created a poll on Twitter, in which 58 percent of the more than 3 million responses indicated he should sell 10 percent of his shares in Tesla.  ""Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock,"" he wrote, adding in a later tweet: ""I will abide by the results of this poll, whichever way it goes.""  Musk sold about $5 billion worth of stock this week - some of it in a planned move related to his stock options - throwing the purpose of the poll partially into question.  faiz.siddiqui@washpost.com   CT 	 http://www.washingtonpost.com[http://www.washingtonpost.com]  RF 	 WP20211112teslaregulation  CO 	 nathg : National Highway Traffic Safety Administration | teslmi : Tesla, Inc.

All Rights Reserved","THE TROUBLE with semiautonomous vehicles? You can't afford to fall asleep at the wheel. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in beginning a broad investigation of systems used in thousands of Tesla's electric cars, has finally woken up.  The imagined future of a driverless fleet rolling down U.S. streets looks a little like a utopia: reducing car ownership, alleviating traffic and making it much easier for the elderly and disabled to move around. Accidents and deaths will also decrease, because today the vast majority are caused by human error; machines, trained and tested, will make dramatically fewer mistakes. This future is one we should want. The problem is, we're nowhere near there. Yet too many car owners act as though we are, and companies can encourage the illusion.","This is the context underlying the NHTSA probe. The agency has been criticized for a lackadaisical approach to its mission beyond the realm of artificially intelligent cars, and the hope was that the new administration would bring changes. The NHTSA will examine nearly a dozen crashes with parked emergency vehicles involving Tesla's Autopilot settings - both of which, crucially, are only partially self-driving and require a human to intervene should the need arise. The NHSTA will look into the common circumstances of the crashes, presumably to detect any defects in the systems' ability to identify obstacles. But crucially, the agency will also assess the way in which the systems do (or don't) keep users engaged.  Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) include a matching emphasis in a letter to the Federal Trade Commission urging its members to look at what the senators described as ""potentially deceptive and unfair practices in Tesla's advertising and marketing."" The manufacturer has been selling an upgraded suite of features called Full Self-Driving as part of a promise to eventually produce vehicles that are, well, fully self-driving. Right now, however, the cars can't drive themselves without human help, a caveat that the owner's manual includes. Tesla has argued that its data shows its cars are safer than average, and that driver-assistance features such as Autopilot make them safer still. But the cars would be even safer than that if the company hammered in the need for user involvement rather than elided it in its marketing.  Regulators, understandably, have been wary of stymying innovation by interfering too much with the development of driverless vehicles. Yet companies risk getting in their cars' own way when they overhype current capabilities, prompting customers to put themselves in dangerous situations whose consequences inspire backlash to the autonomous ambition. Mandating honesty about today's limitations could pave the road for a more promising tomorrow.

Democratic Sens. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.) and Edward J. Markey (Mass.) wrote in a letter to FTC Chair Lina Khan on Wednesday that Tesla ""has repeatedly overstated the capabilities of its vehicles, and these statements increasingly pose a threat to motorists and other users of the road.""  ""We fear that Tesla's Autopilot and FSD features are not as mature and reliable as the company pitches to the public,"" the senators wrote. ""Tesla drivers listen to these claims and believe their vehicles are equipped to drive themselves - with potentially deadly consequence.""  The letter comes days after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched an investigation into Tesla's Autopilot following almost a dozen crashes with first-responder vehicles.  - Bloomberg News  ECONOMY  2020 U.S. income tax payments decreased  Nearly 61 percent of U.S. households paid no federal income taxes during 2020 because of pandemic-related declines in income and boosts to government subsidies that wiped away tax liabilities, according to data from the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.  The number of households owing nothing came in at 106.8 million, up from 75.9 million in 2019, the study, released Wednesday, showed.  The 60.6 percent proportion for last year compares with 43.3 percent over the five years before the pandemic struck.  The number of families owing no federal income taxes is projected to remain high for 2021, around 101.7 million households, or 57.1 percent, according to the estimates.  The data underscore how federal assistance measures, including stimulus payments, tax-free unemployment benefits and expanded child tax credits offset the federal tax bills many families would have otherwise owed during the pandemic.  - Bloomberg News  Also in Business  Old Navy is overhauling its approach to how it designs and markets to plus-size women. Starting Friday, Old Navy will be offering every one of its women's styles in all sizes with no price difference. That means sizes 0 to 28 in stores and up to size 30 online. The 1,200-store chain, Gap Inc.'s low-price division, will also be displaying its large sizes together with the standard sizes on the floor. The fashions will be displayed on mannequins in sizes 4, 12 and 18. Online, the chain is merging its plus size and standard sizes together, with models appearing in all three sizes.  A U.S. judge rejected a request by Toronto-Dominion Bank to dismiss a class-action lawsuit brought in December by credit card customers who alleged the lender did not adhere to the terms of their agreement. Customers who obtained TD credit cards secured by a frozen deposit between 2016 and 2019 were told that if they did not default on payments for seven months, they may be eligible to automatically ""graduate"" to an unsecured credit card. This did not happen, according to documents filed with the United States District Court in New Jersey.  BlackRock and Knighthead Capital Management are investing in a $200 million second round of capital to support the expansion of start-up low-cost carrier Breeze Airways. The funding also includes additional investments by Peterson Partners and Sandlot Partners, which helped provide an initial $100 million in capital that backed the May start of flights by the Utah-based carrier, Breeze Aviation Group said. Breeze offers nonstop flights from relatively small airports, primarily to leisure destinations.  Furniture giant Ikea will offer renewable energy to Swedish households for the first time, tapping into the growing market for green electricity as it further diversifies its business. Starting in September, the company will offer electricity produced from solar plants and wind turbines, together with energy supplier Svea Solar, it said in a statement. It plans to branch out to other markets eventually. With the new service, Ikea aims to encourage the production of more solar and wind capacity.  - From news services   CT 	 http://www.washingtonpost.com[http://www.washingtonpost.com]  RF 	 WP20210819digest0819  CO 	 ftrade : Federal Trade Commission | teslmi : Tesla, Inc.

All Rights Reserved","The nation's top auto safety watchdog has launched a formal investigation of Tesla's driver-assistance system after nearly a dozen crashes involving parked emergency vehicles occurred while Autopilot was engaged.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration inquiry, which was opened Friday and detailed in a document made public Monday, covers 765,000 Teslas - models Y, X, S and 3 - produced from 2014 to 2021. In 11 crashes recorded since 2018, one person was killed and 17 people injured.","The Palo Alto, Calif.-based automaker, which has disbanded its public relations department, did not respond to an emailed request for comment.  The investigation comes as the auto industry races toward a driverless future. Tesla's driver-assistance suite - starting with Autopilot and then its ""Full Self-Driving"" package - is among the most ambitious in its efforts to complete many driving tasks automatically. Waymo, owned by Google parent company Alphabet, is working on a self-driving car, along with an array of competitors sporting names such as Aurora, Cruise and Zoox.  Although regulators and industry experts caution that driver-assistance features do not make a vehicle autonomous, Tesla has sought to capitalize on the perception that such technology will one day enable their vehicles to drive themselves.  The investigation creates a potential wrinkle in those plans. Tesla has put ""Full Self-Driving"" in hundreds of vehicles with the caveat that drivers still must be alert while their cars are in motion. Regulators, so far, have taken a relatively hands-off approach; experts say they are wary of any perception they might be stifling innovation.  The inquiry may signal a new regulatory environment. In June, authorities started requiring manufacturers, including Tesla, to report crashes involving such technology within a day of learning of the incident. On Monday, a NHTSA spokeswoman told The Washington Post that the preliminary investigation will focus on Tesla's Autopilot system and ""technologies and methods used to monitor, assist, and enforce the driver's engagement with driving while Autopilot is in use.""  Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), who serve on the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, said NHTSA is ""rightly investigating"" Tesla's Autopilot after a series of crashes.  ""This probe must be swift, thorough, and transparent to ensure driver and public safety,"" they said in a joint statement. ""It should inform the agency's recommendations on fixes the company must implement to improve the safety of its automated driving and driver assistance technology and prevent future crashes.""  Tesla shares tumbled following word of the federal probe, falling 4.3 percent to close Monday at $686.17.  The agency is examining two systems: Tesla Autopilot and the Traffic Aware Cruise Control. Both are ""partial"" self-driving car systems designed to recognize and avoid oncoming traffic while a human driver retains control of the vehicle. Neither qualifies as autonomous, and drivers are expected to be at the ready even when the systems are turned on.  The investigation carries several touch points that suggest a more sophisticated, focused approach to ensuring driver-assistance systems are safe. The difference, experts say, is that authorities now appear to be taking a hard look at how human drivers interact with these new automated systems.  According to the announcement, investigators will look into the ""operational design domain,"" a term that refers to the range of places and situations in which the Autopilot can be turned on. Under current Tesla design, the driver can turn on Autopilot essentially anywhere. Investigators will also look into aspects of the vehicle's ""operational event detection and response"" technology, which refers to how the vehicle understands its surroundings.  Probing both concepts will bring NHTSA †• a relatively obscure unit of the Department of Transportation whose work typically involves more mundane matters like parts recalls †• into deeply technical debates about how drivers interact with automated technology.  ""As we navigate the emerging world of advanced driving assistance systems, it's important that [safety regulators] have insight into what these vehicles can, and cannot, do,"" National Transportation Safety Board chair Jennifer Homendy said in a statement.  The crashes that are the basis for the federal investigation bear some common threads, even beyond the presence of first-responder vehicles. Most, for example, occurred late at night.  In one incident from late February, a Tesla rear-ended a police cruiser that was conducting a traffic stop after 1 a.m., according to the local ABC affiliate. Local news reports describe a dramatic chain reaction crash that totaled two police cars; five officers and a police dog sustained minor injuries. One officer who had been underneath the vehicle at the time of the collision grabbed onto the car and was pulled along. A person who had been standing on the shoulder of the road when the crash happened was taken to the hospital in critical condition, ABC reported at the time.  The earliest crash cited by NHTSA occurred in January 2018 in Culver City, Calif. Robin Geoola, a carwash owner, had been driving his Tesla Model S to work with the Autopilot on when it slammed into a firetruck.  ""All I remember seeing is just my car stopped and my windshield was shattered, and I didn't know what happened,"" Geoola recalled in a recent interview. ""After I became a little bit more aware, I opened the door. I came out I saw my car was under a firetruck.""  Authorities concluded that both driver and vehicle were at fault. The National Transportation Safety Board investigated the crash and concluded that Geoola's ""inattention and overreliance"" on Autopilot, as well as Tesla's design of the system, caused the crash. Geoola said he wasn't ticketed, saying ""I didn't break any law.""  Geoola had to replace his vehicle after the crash and chose another Tesla, crediting his Model S with saving his life.  ""Same color, same year,"" he said. But there was one key difference: The new one wasn't capable of using Autopilot.  In a May 2018 crash in Laguna Beach, Calif., David Scott Key recalled in a recent interview that he was driving through an area where he likes to go mountain biking and was looking out at the trails. His 2015 Tesla Model S was on Autopilot.  ""All of a sudden I slammed into a police car,"" Key said.  The Laguna Beach Police Department concluded that Key caused the crash by driving too quickly, according to the report of its investigation, but a department spokesman said he wasn't issued a ticket.  Key, an engineer, said he remains confident in the vehicle's Autopilot system despite the crash.  ""It's much, much safer to be on Autopilot than it is to be a human driving, however that does not mean there won't be accidents,"" he said.  NHTSA opened the same kind of review of Autopilot in 2016, after a Tesla driver was killed when his Model S crashed into a tractor-trailer while the system was activated. The review was closed Jan. 19, 2017, †• at the end of the Obama administration †• with NHTSA saying ""a safety-related defect trend has not been identified at this time and further examination of this issue does not appear to be warranted.""  Ed Niedermeyer, communications director for the nonprofit Partners for Automated Vehicle Education, said it's critical for drivers to understand that these systems cannot drive on their own.  He said his organization ""welcomes regulators' engagement with these serious issues and affirms the importance of clear communication about the human role in any driving automation system.""  aaron.gregg@washpost.com  ian.duncan@washpost.com  faiz.siddiqui@washpost.com   CT 	 http://www.washingtonpost.com[http://www.washingtonpost.com]  RF 	 WP20210817TESLAPROBE  CO 	 waymmo : Waymo LLC | nathg : National Highway Traffic Safety Administration | teslmi : Tesla, Inc. | goog : Alphabet Inc.

All Rights Reserved","Federal authorities will require companies such as Tesla and Alphabet-owned Waymo to report incidents involving driver-assistance and automated systems within one day of a learning of a crash, a major change that signals a tougher stance by regulators.  The National Highway Traffic Administration on Tuesday announced the change, which covers systems ranging from what are known as Level 2 to Level 5, encompassing advanced driverassistance systems such as Tesla Autopilot and automated driving systems like the autonomous vehicles being deployed by companies in Silicon Valley and elsewhere.","Companies will be required to report crashes where the ""system was engaged during or immediately before the crash,"" NHTSA said in a news release.  ""Access to [automated driving system] data may show whether there are common patterns in driverless vehicle crashes or systematic problems in operation,"" the agency said.  Waymo declined to comment. Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  While many autonomous vehicles are deployed in states that have regulations on the books, driver assistance systems such as Autopilot have often fallen into a regulatory gray area that allowed incidents to escape further examination. Under the new rules, a company must quickly report crashes involving a death or an injury treated at the hospital, a vehicle towed away, an air bag deployment or the involvement of a pedestrian or cyclist.  Companies must also submit monthly reports of all crashes with injuries or property damage that involve automated systems, NHTSA said.  The systems have come under scrutiny as companies have increasingly put them in the hands of drivers and deployed them on public roads. Uber halted its self-driving vehicle program after one of its SUVs struck and killed a 49-year-old woman pushing a bike across a road in 2018.  And Tesla has come under scrutiny for crashes involving Autopilot, its driver-assistance system that includes features allowing cars to navigate from highway on-ramp to off-ramp, along with detecting stop signs and traffic lights, and automatically parking and summoning the vehicles. In one case, a Tesla operating in Autopilot mode plowed into the side of a tractor-trailer, killing the Tesla's driver. The National Transportation Safety Board said the case involved overreliance on the driver-assistance features.  NHTSA says it has examined more than two dozen incidents involving Autopilot.  ""By mandating crash reporting, the agency will have access to critical data that will help quickly identify safety issues that could emerge in these automated systems,"" Steven Cliff, NHTSA's acting administrator, said in a statement. ""In fact, gathering data will help instill public confidence that the federal government is closely overseeing the safety of automated vehicles.""  According to NHTSA, failure to comply with the mandate could result in fines of up to $22,992 per day and a maximum penalty totaling more than $100 million.  faiz.siddiqui@washpost.com   CT 	 http://www.washingtonpost.com[http://www.washingtonpost.com]  RF 	 WP20210630safetyreporting  CO 	 waymmo : Waymo LLC | teslmi : Tesla, Inc. | goog : Alphabet Inc.

"Document WP00000020210523eh5n0002o","Business","Tesla's path as an 'iPhone on wheels'","Faiz Siddiqui","2667 words","23 May 2021","The Washington Post","WP","FINAL","G03",NA,"English","Copyright 2021, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved","Tesla released its futuristic ""Full Self-Driving"" package last year to great fanfare, criticism and the usual stream of video uploads showing off cars that could seemingly drive themselves.  Then something strange happened.","The electric vehicle giant revoked access for some drivers, it said. Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced on Twitter in March that some users who had received access to the company's most advanced driver-assistance features ""did not pay sufficient attention to the road."" Tesla did not say how it made the determination or who among the feature's 2,000 beta testers - who shelled out thousands for the package that Tesla now priced at $10,000 - would lose access.  But in Silicon Valley, the decision reflected a well-understood formula: Consumers are the subject, and tech giants are in control.  From the time they hit the mass market nearly a decade ago, Tesla's vehicles have garnered reputations as ""iPhones on wheels,"" a revolutionary technological leap that did for cars what Apple's smartphone did for consumer tech. They offered large touch screens, a vast charging network and groundbreaking performance that delivered on the dream of electrification seemingly without compromise, where competing products failed to stitch all aspects of that formula into one.  Like Apple, Tesla built its brand on exclusivity and aspirational products, prioritizing the experience of ownership as much as the utility of the device itself. And both companies have integrated software with hardware in a way that revolutionized their industries, making the transition to new technologies relatively intuitive for even the non-tech-savvy user.  But consumers can pay a price for being locked into Tesla's universe, like Apple customers in the computer giant's ecosystem. They are at the mercy of Tesla's way of doing things, from car repairs to software updates.  It's no accident the companies have a lot in common, according to a half-dozen former employees who worked for both Tesla and Apple, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the workplace dynamics and for fear of retaliation. Tesla hired managers who brought members of their teams from Apple, importing its design language and culture. Meanwhile, those employees could be dismissive of the automotive expertise within its ranks, the former employees said.  ""Tesla is not an automotive company, it's a tech company that builds cars,"" said one former employee of both companies who worked in products.  That also translates to the company's leadership. Musk, who recently crowned himself ""Technoking"" of Tesla, has taken after Apple co-founder and Silicon Valley demigod Steve Jobs in more ways than one, some of the workers said.  Musk has been known to spend meetings scrolling on his phone, before lashing out over decisions he viewed as misguided, outbursts that would often precede a firing, according to the employees.  ""In the same way Steve Jobs could be cutthroat and terse and explosive, Elon is the same way,"" said the former employee, who worked at the companies under both men.  The companies' shared vision includes an emphasis on some forms of proprietary technology. Tesla uses a unique charging connector, similar to Apple products with their ""Lightning"" connectors. It has built out what it says is the world's largest fast-charging network, consisting of more than 25,000 Superchargers. The cars' groundbreaking over-the-air updates mean users can be subject to sudden performance changes if products become out of date - like battery throttling for which Apple has come under fire. Tesla's unique systems have also proved difficult for government authorities investigating crashes to decode, a problem that echoes federal authorities' difficulty unlocking Apple devices.  It's a far cry from a traditional auto industry built largely on standardization - from gas pumps to windshield wipers, to in-car infotainment systems with Apple CarPlay and Android integration. Tesla has its own touch-screen interface that can prove to be a learning curve for new adopters, though it enables a user experience uniquely suited for its cars - an integration of hardware and software reminiscent of Apple.  Tesla, Musk and Apple did not respond to multiple detailed requests for comment. The automaker disbanded its media relations team last year.  Tesla and Musk have said they want their technology to be embraced by other players in the industry. They have promoted open-source software and criticized the overuse of patents, and Musk has even said Tesla's Superchargers are ""being made accessible to other electric cars,"" though it's unclear whether any agreements are actually in place.  Apple says its closed-source environments help it keep its products secure and free of hostile software. Some critics disagree, pointing to areas where the computer giant falls short.  Tesla's performance has dazzled investors. The company's stock has skyrocketed in recent months, prompting Musk to tweet in March that he sees Tesla becoming the world's biggest company, surpassing even Apple's more than $2 trillion market cap. (By late April, Tesla was worth more than $675 billion.)  In recent years, some current and former employees said, Tesla has become the more attractive workplace for some in Silicon Valley.  Fueling that recruiting: The prospect of working for a visionary CEO or a company with a goal to change the world. Musk has overseen Tesla's modern development into the industry leader in electric vehicles. And Tesla has pitched that vision to many who were otherwise concerned about its scrappy, start-up environment that paled in comparison to the state-of-the-art ""spaceship"" headquarters of Apple or the food and beverage perks of Google or Facebook.  One corporate recruiter in Silicon Valley described the funnel of interchanging talent between Apple and Tesla as ""incestuous."" The companies share talent pools of engineers from top schools, the current and former workers said, though Tesla is much less concerned about a person's formal education credentials than Apple, they said. The person recently in charge of Tesla's vehicle and mobile user interface design, for example, was previously a senior art director at Apple, though he recently departed Tesla as well. Tesla hired Apple alumnus George Blankenship to lead its retail strategy a decade ago, putting sleek showrooms in malls and city centers, mimicking the experience-focused store model he had pioneered at Apple.  ""There is a strong Tesla-to-Apple pipeline that is well-known within both companies,"" said another recruiter.  Even Musk has publicly heaped praise on Apple and its workers.  ""It's a great company with a lot of talented people. I love their products,"" he wrote on Twitter in 2015, saying he was glad to hear about plans that Apple was developing an electric vehicle.  Automotive alums from Detroit did not garner the same respect, however. ""There was no empathy for these people in Michigan,"" said the recruiter, describing how Tesla expected them to jump at any opportunity to work in Silicon Valley. And in the halls of Tesla, the auto alums were regarded as ""dinosaurs,"" the former products employee recalled.  That talent swap with Apple has helped Tesla build a car company that attempts to mimic the successes of the older tech giant, the current and former workers say, in some cases foisting new designs on consumers without market research to back them up.  ""I think that we have an empathy problem, a systemic empathy problem, in Silicon Valley,"" one of the former employees said, pointing to what he regarded as the companies' elite attitudes and disdain for market research.  The former employees pointed to polarizing product unveilings like the Cybertruck, which took the proven design of the pickup truck and transformed it into an apocalyptic stainless steel behemoth.  Then there are the system updates.  Months after buying a used Tesla Model S for nearly $46,000, Harpreet Singh began to notice the car wouldn't travel far enough on a single charge to cover his work trips frequently stretching more than 200 miles.  Tesla had taken about 40 miles of range off his used Model S, which began with 265 miles, in what Tesla said was an effort to protect the battery. The update also slowed down charging times, Singh said. Tesla ultimately agreed to replace what it later concluded was a faulty battery, but at the expense of what Singh has found is slower acceleration.  After the car and its new battery were working properly, Singh began to dread system updates, because they introduced new problems like the shorter range and decreased charging rates.  Singh said he thinks about it like other tech updates. ""I'm so comfortable with Windows 8. . . . Why do I have to change to Windows 10? And then everything breaks,"" said Singh, 33, of Cypress, Tex. ""Same thing here. . . . They can do anything to do it.""  That issue, among others, led to a lawsuit from Tesla owners who allege the company issued software updates that reduced range, lengthened charging times and ultimately cut into the value of their vehicles. The plaintiff named in the 2019 class-action complaint, David Rasmussen, 64, of Victorville, Calif., said his used Tesla Model S went from 252 miles of rated range to 217 miles after the software changes. And he said some owners tried to find workarounds to resist software updates.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has an open investigation into Tesla's battery management software updates.  Tesla has argued it uses over-the-air updates for safety improvements and to enhance the ownership experience.  Apple was accused of ""throttling"" old devices, slowing down customers' iPhones to preserve their batteries as operating systems updated, essentially nudging them into buying new devices. The company agreed in late 2020 to pay $113 million to settle an investigation by nearly three dozen states on the matter. The agreements with states did not require Apple to admit guilt.  Tesla isn't the only automaker updating its vehicles over the air, but it has made a mark on the industry by using the technology to introduce dramatic changes that affect driving dynamics, even improving the cars' brakes overnight. Some of the changes would require a trip to the dealer for any other automaker. Jaguar, for example, boosted the range of its I-PACE electric vehicles by 12 miles in 2019, but the tweak required an in-person service to unlock.  Some of the employees who made the leap between Tesla and Apple said they found Tesla to be sloppier on execution. Tesla put still-developing products, from Autopilot software to its newest cars, in the hands of consumers without the steady hand and design direction preventing the software bugs and quality control flaws.  Tesla billed its ""Autopilot"" driver-assistance suite as a way to enable the car to drive itself, with its ultimate iteration ""Full Self-Driving"" ushering in the era of fully autonomous vehicles for consumers. But industry competitors and safety-minded officials are wary of Tesla's nomenclature, saying it paints an impression far beyond the vehicles' actual capabilities.  Owners have taken notice of the shortcomings. Stephen Raynor, an attorney who lives Richardson, Tex., was alarmed when his Model S equipped with Full Self-Driving abruptly veered toward a highway barrier as it approached a toll road exit near his home.  ""It's just not ready for prime time,"" he said of Tesla's Autopilot suite. ""It just didn't read it right and it wanted to go left and the exit was right.""  Tesla has argued that Autopilot carries a nearly 10 times lower chance of a crash than a vehicle in normal driving. The company says its connected fleet enables it to ""develop features that can help Tesla drivers mitigate or avoid accidents."" And Tesla says its over-the-air software updates allow it to make safety enhancements well after a car has been delivered.  Apple's focus on hardware and software integration has in some cases meant higher costs, limited compatibility and little customization. Apple didn't want users to manipulate its closed-source environments or mess with its meticulously designed products.  Tesla has made similar design decisions, even ones viewed as user-hostile, or that flew in the face of common industry practice. The company recently debuted a ""yoke""-style steering wheel for its refreshed Model S. With a half-moon shape that sacrificed ergonomics for a racing-inspired, futuristic look, the component was criticized as a downgrade to user-friendliness, which analysts said had implications for safety.  And Tesla has even stated it aims to phase out the gear selector, replacing the standard park, reverse, drive and neutral setup with a gear ""swipe"" option in the cars' center screens, to flick between drive and reverse. Tesla said it ultimately wants its cars to predict whether they should be going forward or backward.  Apple, too, had made design decisions that struck some as tone-deaf. Jobs famously eschewed market research, saying it was instead the job of the company to show customers what they wanted. The company nixed the ubiquitous headphone jack from its smartphones, forcing the adoption of Bluetooth ear buds, and has eliminated certain ports in favor of thinness and streamlined design, making users rely on dongles to connect accessories. And it came under a swarm of criticism for its ""butterfly keyboard,"" a space-saving component noted for its tendency to break before Apple phased it out.  Adding to the pattern: a trend toward shorter life spans generally associated with tech devices vs. traditional cars.  Consumers and critics balked earlier this year when Tesla's acting general counsel argued with regulators that its cars' iPad-like touch screens should not be expected to last the life span of the vehicle, an argument that was anathema to an industry used to ""automotive grade"" components. That was a key issue for Tesla because the touch screens serve as a command center for the car, hosting the climate controls, navigation and music, and even functions such as opening the glove box.  After initially sparring with regulators, Tesla agreed to recall tens of thousands of Model S and X vehicles over the touch screen failures.  ""It's like its superpower and Achilles' heel at the same time: It doesn't do things by the rule book,"" said a former senior employee.  Analysts said Tesla turned the traditional carmaker-owner relationship on its head.  ""The argument that equipment on modern cars that cost that much is not expected to last that long - that is a major violation of the auto industry as we know it,"" said Mike Ramsey, an automotive analyst at the firm Gartner's CIO Research Group. ""If you're going to adopt the consumer electronics ethos, you can't do it halfway.""  Full Self-Driving features are also not transferrable between cars, meaning an owner who has shelled out $10,000 for the software would have to buy it for their next Tesla as well.  Musk has said, however, that Tesla will look into upping the trade-in value for a vehicle with Full Self-Driving, after some owners complained about having to purchase it twice.  Tesla has also sought to restrict how drivers use the features it bills as self-driving, suggesting they could not, for instance, use them for ride-hailing on Uber and Lyft. Instead they could leverage them only for Tesla's own ride-hailing network built by a fleet that Musk envisioned would consist of 1 million robo-taxis by 2020, a target date that proved overly optimistic.  Owners also face difficulty finding easy repairs and frequently turn to Tesla out of fear they will void their warranties. Raynor, the Texas attorney, said his Model S touch screen suddenly went half-blank for two days, limiting access to features such as the backup camera and climate controls.  ""With all the electronics, very few mechanics want to get near it,"" he said.  faiz.siddiqui@washpost.com  Reed Albergotti contributed to this report.

All Rights Reserved","TEXAS  Authorities search for triple-shooting suspect","A 41-year-old man is wanted in the fatal shooting of three people in Austin, and police officials searching the surrounding area on Sunday warned residents that the suspect might take a hostage.  Interim Austin police chief Joseph Chacon said the suspect, Stephen Broderick, is considered armed and dangerous.  He asked area residents to continue to shelter in place and to call their neighbors to check on them.  ""We are concerned he might possibly take a hostage and be himself sheltered somewhere waiting for us to leave,"" Chacon said at a news conference Sunday afternoon.  He described Broderick as 5-foot-7 and black, wearing a gray hoodie, sunglasses and a baseball cap. He said that Broderick was a former deputy with the Travis County sheriff's office, which is based in Austin.  Chacon said police do not know whether he is in a vehicle or on foot.  Chacon said Broderick is suspected in the killing of two Hispanic women and one Black man. He said Broderick knew the victims, but he didn't elaborate.  Chacon also said that a child at the scene is safe with authorities.  Brenda Torres said she was driving by when she saw a young boy flag down a car and a Black man lying facedown on the ground.  ""I saw the little boy point down the street,"" Torres said. ""There was someone lying on the ground. I thought someone had just fallen down or something. As my light turns green and I'm driving, I see cop car after cop car after cop car rushing toward where I just was.""  Chacon said the three were not shot in a building but did not give additional details.  - Associated Press  No driver apparent  in fatal Tesla crash  A Tesla electric car that ""no one"" appeared to be driving crashed late Saturday near Houston, erupting into flames and killing the two passengers, local authorities said.  One victim was found in the front passenger seat of a 2019 Model S, and the other was in the rear, Harris County Precinct 4 Constable Mark Herman said. The car ran into a tree in the Carlton Woods subdivision near the Woodlands after traveling at high speed and failing to navigate a turn.  The position of the victims, statements and other physical evidence suggest that ""no one was driving the vehicle at the time of impact,"" Herman said. ""It's still under investigation.""  Herman said he didn't know whether the car's autopilot feature was engaged.  Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday.  Federal officials have criticized Tesla for fire risks related to the battery packs in its cars and for not doing enough to keep drivers from using its driver-assist function inappropriately.  - Bloomberg News  ILLINOIS  7-year-old girl killed, father hurt in shooting  A 7-year-old girl was killed and her father was seriously injured in a shooting Sunday at a McDonald's in Chicago.  Jontae Adams and his daughter, Jaslyn, were in a car Sunday afternoon in a McDonald's parking lot in the Homan Square neighborhood when they were shot, Chicago police said.  A McDonald's employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity told the Chicago Sun-Times that two people got out of a gray car in the drive-through and started shooting at Adams's car.  The girl, who has three siblings, was shot repeatedly. She was taken to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Her father was shot in the torso and taken to the same hospital, where his condition was listed as serious, police said.  No arrests have been made and police have not offered a possible motive.  - Associated Press  Warrant issued for teen in fatal Nebraska shooting: A murder warrant has been issued for a teenage boy suspected in a shooting at a Nebraska mall that left one man dead and a woman injured, police said Sunday. Omaha police said Makhi Woolridge-Jones, 16, is wanted on a charge of first-degree murder in the shooting Saturday at the Westroads Mall in Omaha. Brandon Woolridge-Jones, 18, has been arrested on a charge of being an accessory to the shooting. Police said a third man has been identified as a person of interest in the shooting but did not release his name. Police said Trequez Swift, 21, was shot and died at an Omaha hospital. A woman, Ja'Keya Veland, 22, was wounded in the leg.  Chicago high schools' reopening approved: The Chicago Teachers Union has approved a plan to reopen high schools starting Monday, the union said Sunday. The union tweeted that ""the CTU Rules & Elections Committee has certified the ballot results of the high school addendum to our reopening agreement with CPS. Members voted 83% in favor of ratification."" It added: ""The addendum is now a ratified agreement between our union and the district."" The vote to reopen public high schools to students for the first time since they were closed last year because of the coronavirus pandemic was expected.  - From news services   CT 	 http://www.washingtonpost.com[http://www.washingtonpost.com]  RF 	 WP20210419domestic0419  NS 	 gcrim : Crime/Legal Action | gmurd : Murder/Manslaughter | nnam : News Agency Materials | nsum : News Digests | gcat : Political/General News | ncat : Content Types | nfact : Factiva Filters | nfce : C&E Exclusion Filter | niwe : IWE Filter  RE 	 ustx : Texas | usa : United States | austin : Austin | namz : North America | uss : Southern U.S.  IPD 	 National-Politics  PUB 	 Washington Post",NA
"Document WP00000020210228eh2s0003t","Business","Musk's load is showing at Tesla","Faiz Siddiqui","2453 words","28 February 2021","The Washington Post","WP","FINAL","G02",NA,"English","Copyright 2021, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved","SAN FRANCISCO - Elon Musk says he is stretched too thin.  The chief executive of both electric car manufacturer Tesla and rocket company SpaceX bounces nearly daily on his private jet between locations - traveling to his longtime home in Southern California, Tesla's plant in the Bay Area, the site of a new factory in Austin, and SpaceX's launch facility on that state's Gulf Coast.","Twice in a matter of days recently, the 49-year-old complained of what he called an ""insane"" work schedule, juggling responsibilities with his car company and aerospace firm and taking in ""torrents of information"" in wall-to-wall meetings.  But critics say the rigors of Musk's schedule, and the seeming cult of personality that has developed around him, are beginning to show in the car company he runs - the one that he took from an upstart pioneer in electric vehicles to the world's most valuable automaker. Musk, they say, is drowning in commitments like his aerospace company and other endeavors while letting quality - and strategy - at Tesla fall victim. And there are familiar concerns.  ""There have been years past where some of his behavior was horrifying and had cost huge costs, especially from his little tussle with the SEC,"" said Ross Gerber, a Tesla investor and supporter of Musk who is close to the company. ""And he's come a long way. What I'm worried about is his success makes him a little bit loose again.""  Musk spent much of the past year trying to demonstrate his aerospace firm's viability to shuttle people into space on reusable rockets, while Tesla worked to construct multiple factories and launched a new SUV. He also juggled the birth of a son and his personal move to Texas. He sprinkled in public appearances in venues such as social media app Clubhouse in between his barrages of tweets. Musk became the world's richest person in January, thanks to skyrocketing Tesla stock.  In interviews with a dozen current and former Tesla employees, investors and analysts, critics pointed to a slate of questionable business moves, and outright missteps by Tesla, as a potential symptom of the outside demands on Musk. They described a company where Musk is less present and increasingly isolated, where subordinates are reluctant to question the CEO's vision and where the de facto position entails eschewing market research. It's a top-down, shoot-by-the-hip ethos directed by Musk.  Tesla did not respond to repeated requests for comment. In response to emails seeking comment, Musk replied only:""Give my regards to your puppet master.""  In a regulatory filing in February, the company highlighted the risk it faces by relying so much on Musk.  ""We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer and largest stockholder,"" Tesla said in the filing, in language unusual for the way it cited a corporate CEO's numerous outside commitments. ""Although Mr. Musk spends significant time with Tesla and is highly active in our management, he does not devote his full time and attention to Tesla.""  The filing cited Musk's helm over SpaceX and ""other emerging technology ventures."" Along with Tesla and SpaceX, Musk leads an outfit focused on merging the human brain with computers, Neuralink, along with a tunnel-building firm, Boring Co.  Musk's impulsive leadership has worked to Tesla's benefit so far. His bets have vaulted it to the world's most valuable automaker. The company delivered a record of nearly 500,000 vehicles in 2020 and has cannibalized prospective U.S. electric vehicle sales from practically every other automaker.  But cracks have started to appear as Tesla has stumbled on some vehicle releases and as its vehicles grow older, prompting some recalls. Regulators are scrutinizing the company for fires and some of its more innovative features.  ""There isn't a culture at Tesla really other than 'Let's do what Elon wants to do,' "" said Ed Niedermeyer, who wrote the book ""Ludicrous: The Unvarnished Story of Tesla Motors.""  ""He becomes more powerful, and that power sort of isolates him more and more.""  Current and former Tesla employees described Musk as less present on the factory floor in recent months, involving himself primarily in higher-profile events, like end-of-quarter delivery crunches and matters related to the company's earnings calls and investor presentations. That's a contrast from around three years ago, when the chief executive was known to sleep at the factory as the Model 3 faced production issues.  ""I think the stress is definitely less now that the company's more established,"" said one former employee on an automation team paid close attention by Musk, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on company matters. ""His pressure on certain things has certainly dropped.""  Musk grew up in South Africa and went on to study in Canada and then the University of Pennsylvania. He emerged as a tech titan with the sale of the site he co-founded, PayPal, to eBay in 2002. Musk, the payments platform's onetime CEO, pocketed $165 million. He founded SpaceX in 2002, with the ambition to take humans to Mars in a private venture.  He invested in Tesla in 2004, a year after its founding, and holds more than a 20 percent stake in the company, according to a regulatory filing this month. He was named chairman in 2004, though he would lose that title in the wake of a 2018 spat with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Musk became Tesla CEO in 2008 and proceeded to mastermind the launch of a series of electric cars that were sporty and aspirational, yet carried enough range to make them practical. That combination helped bring electrification to the masses, as Tesla went from niche luxury automaker to an electric vehicle powerhouse, selling nearly half a million vehicles per year.  Musk has more than 47 million followers on Twitter, thanks in part to a bombastic personality there that has landed him in trouble.  He's cut in the mold of many tech company CEOs, who are under constant pressure to keep their companies fresh and innovative. But as Tesla reaches middle age, it faces similar risks as other personality-driven Silicon Valley start-ups turned giants.  Apple CEO Steve Jobs was known for his vision until his death in 2011 prompted what some view as a loss of innovation at the tech giant. Amazon will soon face the transition of founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos to executive chairman, testing the culture he has instilled. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.)  ""The biggest asset within Tesla is Elon,"" said Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities who has followed Musk's moves closely over the years. He added that some have worried what will happen if ""Musk feels like he's had massive success with Tesla, he's built an unparalleled brand and now he could go from fifth gear to third gear.""  Even Musk recently questioned how long he can keep it up.  ""Nobody is or should be CEO forever,"" he observed during a Tesla earnings call late last month, launching a wave of speculation - almost certainly premature - about a potential looming departure. ""It would be nice to have a bit more free time.""  It's a far cry from just two years ago, when the company's stock hit a recent low amid production and demand concerns. Musk had faced an SEC investigation costing him and Tesla $20 million each, and he lost his chair on the company's board in 2018.  Musk has come out of the pandemic more famous and respected than ever. He is, depending on the day, the world's richest or second-richest person. Fortune named him its 2020 Businessperson of the Year. He made Gallup's poll of the world's most admired men, sandwiched between Pope Francis and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the top 10.  After hitting a near-term low of $177 per share in mid-2019, Tesla's stock soared to a new high of more than $2,000 just over a year later, before the company implemented a 5-for-1 split late last summer. Tesla's cash flow woes had abated and the company was posting consecutive quarters of profitability.  Tesla faced an unusual stumble in late 2019, when the company released a polarizing pickup, dubbed the Cybertruck. While its sci-fi-derived design won over the company's most ardent fans, the angular proportions and stainless steel exoskeleton were off-putting to many who would have otherwise been interested in a Tesla pickup, and it remains unclear whether the truck can be legally built with its current specifications.  As the coronavirus took hold, Musk started tweeting that the panic over it was ""dumb."" And he wrote that there would be ""close to zero new cases"" by the end of April a year ago. He was on a call with Trump where he pushed reopening and praised the president. He had a public meltdown during an earnings call in late April, raging against California officials' shutdown orders in an expletive-laden rant.  ""To say that they cannot leave their house and they will be arrested if they do, this is fascist,"" he said on the call. ""This is not democratic - this is not freedom.""  Jennifer Chatman, a management professor at the University of California at Berkeley's Haas School of Business, pointed to Tesla's firing of workers who had opted to stay home during the pandemic, a broken promise to workers first reported by The Post.  ""Every time you reduce the quality of Tesla as a workplace, then by definition you're going to reduce the quality of the employees who are willing to work there,"" she said.  In May, Musk sent his company's stock plunging with an eyebrow-raising tweet questioning its value. He also used Twitter to announce the birth of a son, X à† A-Xii (initially spelled X à† A-12 but changed to comply with California regulations).  ""I am selling almost all physical possessions,"" Musk wrote during that whirlwind period in May. ""Will own no house.""  That same month, Musk oversaw the most important mission in SpaceX's history, with the successful launch to space - and safe return - of a pair of NASA astronauts, becoming the first private company to fly humans into orbit.  And like so many Californians who have become fed up with the state's politics and frequent natural disasters, Musk last year moved to Texas.  As he moved and focused more energy on SpaceX, Tesla employees said he didn't have the same presence he once did. Special requests from Musk dwindled.  Tesla's hotly anticipated Model Y crossover, released in 2020, has struggled, prompting the company to yank some variations from the lineup and cut the price by up to $3,000 at a time. Its refreshed Model S includes a controversial half-moon ""yoke""-style steering wheel that aims to automate turn signals and gear selections, something likely to be scrutinized by regulators.  The Model Y faced quality control concerns after its launch early last year, including reports that the roof of a brand-new vehicle blew off, and a back seat was not attached. Some analysts attributed poor build quality to the strain of producing cars during the pandemic.  Meanwhile, Tesla in October debuted the feature suite it dubs ""Full Self-Driving"" amid regulatory and industry concerns it was not ready. The company is not using the most advanced hardware available and is instead opting for a cheaper approach that relies on a series of interconnected cameras to stitch together live images of what the car sees.  Some of Tesla's current fleet of passenger vehicles are nearing a decade old - with the flagship Model S and the Model X SUV facing a recall over faulty high-tech screens that failed to meet automotive standards.  And observers balked at Tesla's response to the screen recall ordered by federal regulators in January. The company's vice president of legal argued that Tesla's giant center screens should not be expected to last the life span of the vehicle, raising concerns about the longevity of the cars overall.  Musk now finds himself with the chance to expand Tesla's global reach in Europe and Asia, and stretch its appeal to the middle of the country where Tesla plans to build its Cybertruck.  Tesla has started construction on a factory in Austin, and another near Berlin that is expected to supply its vehicles in Europe. Meanwhile, it is continuing an aggressive expansion into Asia, after the company built a facility in Shanghai where it is manufacturing a locally made variant of its Model 3 and Model Y.  Musk has staked his bets on the Model Y crossover, which he has said will outsell its models S, X and 3 combined. He says he ultimately wants Tesla to build 20 million cars per year.  Such claims might normally strike investors as pie-in-the-sky predictions.  ""Even a Jobs comparison is unfair at times because [Musk is] even one step even more extreme in terms of what he's done publicly,"" said Gene Munster, an investor and managing partner of Loup Ventures who follows Tesla and Musk closely. ""There is a group of founders and CEOs that are controversial but do a great job for shareholders, and that's Steve Jobs and that's Elon.""  Investors and analysts point to more recent concerning signs. Just this month, Tesla said in a business filing that it had invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin and would begin accepting the cryptocurrency as a payment. While it's a potentially savvy move to benefit from the volatile cryptocurrency, analysts also said it entails serious financial risk.  After Musk last weekend opined on Twitter that the value of cryptocurrencies seemed too high, bitcoin values fell by around $10,000.  ""We're seeing this with Elon Musk: a lack of impulse control,"" said Chatman, the UC-Berkeley professor.  One employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about company matters, said he winced as he learned a fellow factory employee had poured $70,000 derived from company-issued Tesla stock into bitcoin, following Musk's lead.  ""He knows whatever he says, people do and he's taking advantage of it,"" the worker said. He recalled warning his co-worker that Musk ""doesn't care about you; he'll ruin you.""  faiz.siddiqui@washpost.com   CT 	 http://www.washingtonpost.com[http://www.washingtonpost.com]  RF 	 WP20210228MUSK  CO 	 spaetc : Space Exploration Technologies Corp. | teslmi : Tesla, Inc.

"Document WP00000020201022egam0002a","A-Section","Tesla moves toward 'full self-driving' amid criticism the tech is not ready","Faiz Siddiqui","1867 words","22 October 2020","The Washington Post","WP","FINAL","A22",NA,"English","Copyright 2020, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved","SAN FRANCISCO - In a year when Tesla might have been forgiven for extending its timeline on a key initiative, Elon Musk is forging ahead with a vision for what he calls ""Full Self-Driving.""  This week, a group of drivers was selected to receive a software update that downloaded automatically into their cars, enabling the vehicles to better steer and accelerate without human hands and feet. According to Tesla, hundreds of thousands of its cars will be able to drive themselves as soon as this year, probably making them the first large fleet of vehicles billed as autonomous owned by ordinary consumers.","Tesla is forging ahead despite skepticism among some safety advocates about whether Tesla's technology is ready - and whether the rest of the world is ready for cars that drive themselves. An industry coalition consisting of General Motors' Cruise, Ford, Uber and Waymo, among others, this week criticized the move by Tesla, saying its vehicles are not truly autonomous because they still require an active driver.  Self-driving is lightly regulated in the United States, and Tesla does not need permission to launch the new feature.  A point of contention among Tesla's critics is that the company is moving ahead without a key piece of hardware. Nearly all makers of self-driving cars have embraced lidar sensors, which are placed on the outside of vehicles and can detect the precise size, shape and depth of objects in real time, even in bad weather.  Instead, Tesla is trying to achieve full self-driving with a suite of cameras and a type of radar that are constantly connected to an advanced neural network. Tesla's technology can detect vehicles and pedestrians in the road and some objects such as trees, but it cannot always see the true shape or depth of the obstacles it encounters, according to some safety experts. That might not allow the car to distinguish between a box truck and a semi as it approached the rig from behind, for example.  Tesla CEO Musk has decried lidar as ""expensive,"" redundant and ""a fool's errand,"" calling anyone who relied on it ""doomed.""  In addition, unlike autonomous vehicle companies such as Waymo and Cruise, which have been testing their self-driving cars in controlled pilot programs, Tesla has decided to put its self-driving technology into the hands of consumers. That means the risks of a malfunction will be absorbed by ordinary drivers.  Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. The company has said it will not activate full self-driving until it receives regulatory approval, though it remains unknown exactly what certification would be needed. Musk said on Twitter the self-driving beta rollout would be ""extremely slow & cautious, as it should.""  The company reported its quarterly earnings Wednesday, posting a $331 million profit.  Demonstrating the challenges, in one such recent update, some Tesla cars could detect red lights and stop signs but would not proceed through the intersection until the driver confirmed via the accelerator or steering wheel stalk that the traffic light was green, according to Tesla.  ""The fundamental challenge of neural nets is achieving sufficient reliability to use in a safety-critical system,"" said Edward Niedermeyer, communications director for the Partners for Automated Vehicle Education (PAVE) campaign, a coalition of nonprofits seeking to help the public better understand driverless technology.  ""I'm puzzled as to where the confidence came from almost four years ago that they'd be able to do this,"" said Niedermeyer, who wrote the 2019 book ""Ludicrous: The Unvarnished Story of Tesla Motors."" ""The reason you do these things is because it's an extremely hard problem, and it's not realistic to solve this problem with some cameras.""  Virtual lidar  Silicon Valley regards autonomous vehicles as the holy grail of transportation's future, enabling customers to deploy their cars as driverless robo-taxis, making the owners money even when they would be typically parked in the garage, in Tesla's case. It could also shrink the cost of an Uber or Lyft trip to just cents on the mile by eliminating the need to pay a driver.  Several companies are making slow but steady progress on that goal, too. Waymo announced this month that it would be launching driverless vehicles in the Phoenix metro area, becoming the first entity to bring the vision of fully autonomous cars to consumers as part of a dedicated ride-hailing service. Last week, Cruise said it would launch driverless cars in San Francisco, becoming the first company to debut unmanned vehicles in such a complex city environment and the country's second-densest metropolis.  Tesla's public timeline has been rapid. Musk promised in 2019 Tesla would have 1 million robo-taxis on the road by 2020, a reference to the company's full-self-driving ambitions.  The company's self-driving technology will make use of the eight surrounding-view cameras attached to its cars. Those cameras collect critical data on how to navigate chaotic freeways, labyrinthine city streets and dense traffic.  Musk has said the new software being delivered this week will better capture the view outside the cars and more seamlessly integrate the footage Tesla collects, creating a kind of stitched-together, multidimensional view. It will collect data that the company's engineers can label and help the computers better interpret. The cameras would replicate a core function of lidar, seeing what is happening around the cars.  In essence, Tesla is aiming to compensate for its hardware limitations by supercharging its software, almost to create a virtual lidar using Tesla's existing suite of cameras, said Eshak Mir, a former Tesla Autopilot engineer who reviewed and worked with data aimed at training Tesla's neural network.  ""They're trying to combine all the feeds from the cameras into one full video and label it in real time,"" Mir said. ""With that, you'll be able to pick up a full sense of depth.""  There is no true industry hardware standard for a self-driving car. But before Tesla came along, there was little question that a sophisticated sensor in the vein of lidar was necessary for the redundancy and complex image processing required of self-driving vehicles. Some experts continue to hold that view.  Overcast skies, rain, snowstorms and especially bright sunlight can challenge mere cameras' perception. ""In normal daylight conditions, the cameras work perfectly fine,"" Mir said.  ""Just from my experience, cameras are very dependable, but at the same time there can be a challenge when there's harsh conditions,"" added Mir, who supports Tesla's current approach.  For the broader, lidar-equipped fleets, safety setbacks - including a fatal crash when a pedestrian was struck by a self-driving Uber in 2018 - have led to delays and slower timelines for autonomous vehicles as a whole. And some are questioning whether truly driverless vehicles are possible.  ""They say that it's just around the corner, but you don't realize that the effort to get just around the corner gets more and more and more [complicated] as you get closer to the corner,"" said Ted Pavlic, an Arizona State University assistant professor in the School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems Engineering, who works in robotics and autonomous systems.  Companies developing dedicated robo-cars for ride-hailing purposes, such as Waymo, Amazon-acquired Zoox, Uber and Cruise, all use lidar in their vehicles. They consider lidar a critical element of redundancy capable of making rapid-fire observations in all manner of conditions, filling in gaps where the cameras fall short.  On a recent autonomous vehicle trip in downtown San Francisco, for example, the lidar sensor spotted vehicle traffic over a steep hill before the camera suite or view out the windshield showed it, and the car began making adjustments earlier than a human driver might have. Most testing of autonomous vehicles has been with lidar.  Waymo conducted 1.45 million miles' worth of autonomous vehicle testing in California last year, the company reported to the state Department of Motor Vehicles. Tesla vehicles drove a total of 12.2 autonomous miles, to record what it called a ""demo run"" around its Palo Alto headquarters. Tesla has argued that it ""has a fleet of hundreds of thousands of customer-owned vehicles that test autonomous technology in 'shadow-mode' during their normal operation,"" constantly improving through billions of miles of real-world driving. Shadow Mode allows it to test some of those automated features without actually activating them in the real world.  Autopilot concerns  Still, Tesla has been dogged by safety concerns, including regulatory investigations and multiple crashes involving Autopilot that have resulted in fatalities and injuries. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has said it is looking into more than a dozen incidents involving the Autopilot software. Tesla has also faced lawsuits from the families of victims in Autopilot-related crashes.  Tesla has repeatedly defended the Autopilot system, saying it is merely there to assist the driver, who is ultimately responsible for the safe operation of the car.  Autopilot, Tesla's driver-assistance system that operates like an advanced cruise control function, has been criticized for giving users an exaggerated view of its cars' capabilities. At this stage, the cars are capable of highway driving from on-ramp to off-ramp, self-parking and summoning - where they can navigate to the driver in a crowded parking lot, for example. In cities, Tesla's vehicles can detect traffic lights and stop signs. It is not autonomous, however, and Tesla has faced criticism for giving users the impression the system is capable of driving the car itself - without supervision.  ""Autopilot is not an autonomous system and does not make our vehicles autonomous,"" the company noted in a disclosure to the state DMV. California's vehicle codes, for example, state that autonomous test vehicles must be capable of ""performing the dynamic driving task on a sustained basis without the constant control or active monitoring of a natural person.""  Pavlic, who works with autonomous systems, recently purchased a Tesla Model 3 but didn't opt for the $8,000 ""Full Self-Driving"" package.  He said Tesla risks giving users an exaggerated impression of the cars' capabilities with the over-the-air updates, various iterations of Autopilot and ""Full Self-Driving"" marketing.  ""It requires you to be very educated to be able to parse these things,"" he said. ""I would say I can definitely see how someone might think that Autopilot did more than it did . . . as they're rolling out these new features.""  Tesla owners are no stranger to the challenges, observing how new and previous unpredicted sights can leave their cars confused.  Zlatko Unger, a 36-year-old Model 3 owner who lives in Redwood City, Calif., recalled taking his car to a horse park he frequents on a weekend in late July, when his car detected a hazard it displayed on its info screen.  ""I noticed it picked up the piles of poop as [traffic] cones, and I was like, hey, this is not right,"" he said.  faiz.siddiqui@washpost.com   CT 	 http://www.washingtonpost.com[http://www.washingtonpost.com]  RF 	 WP20201022TESLAFULLSELFDRIVING  CO 	 waymmo : Waymo LLC | teslmi : Tesla, Inc. | ubrti : Uber Technologies Inc. | goog : Alphabet Inc. | ubrib : Uber International B.V.

The seemingly unexplained incident a few weeks ago, captured by onboard cameras, led federal highway safety regulators to take swift action and all but order the vehicles off the road while they launched a review. In a letter to operators using the same kind of shuttle, an official with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration wrote that continuing to carry passengers ""may present an unacceptable safety risk.""","As the footage from the Columbus shuttle begins, the safety operator and two passengers are aboard, chatting with one another about how the shuttle works.

The city fire department sent medics, who took the 44-year-old woman to the hospital with minor injuries.  NHTSA said the suspension order affects 16 French-made EasyMile shuttles being used in projects in 10 states.  Two of them are in Virginia: one at the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute and the other in a partnership between Fairfax County and utility Dominion Energy. But neither project is carrying passengers, and officials say they do not expect the NHTSA order to disrupt their plans.  About 100 people die in traffic crashes every day when humans are at the wheel, so the incident in Columbus might have been barely a blip. But NHTSA's sweeping action underscores the continuing uncertainty about how to handle the self-driving vehicles that are being tested on public roads across the country.  The agency has faced repeated criticism in recent months that it is doing too little to set standards and ensure safety, and yet in a case where it did take decisive action, it faced new questions about its motivations.  Jason Levine, the executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, said the decision to halt EasyMile's operations might have been the right move.  But he said the announcement, coming on the same day as a National Transportation Safety Board hearing during which NHTSA was faulted for its oversight of Tesla's partially automated cars, ""smacks of a PR stunt.""  Because of the rules governing how the EasyMile shuttles are imported, NHTSA had the legal authority to suspend operations, according to its letter to operators. The agency took a similar action to rein in another project using an EasyMile shuttle in 2018 that it said was operating an unapproved school bus.  Officials in Columbus are using the shuttles as part of a federally funded test project, one of dozens using low-speed vehicles that are in theory safer than full-size cars or SUVs. Alyssa Chenault, a spokeswoman for the city's smart transportation initiative, said the vehicles began running through a residential area in early February, with the aim of connecting people to social services and regular transit.  Chenault said a team from EasyMile came to Columbus this week to begin an investigation into the cause of the incident. In a statement, the company said the vehicle was traveling at 7.1 mph before it stopped.  The shuttle ""made an emergency stop as it is programmed to do,"" the company said. ""We operate at such low speeds precisely for this reason: our shuttles can make sudden stops when they detect a safety risk.""  But video captured by the cameras on the shuttles' front and back don't show anything in the street at the moment it lurches to a halt - something a NHTSA official noted in the letter to operators.  ""Evaluation of the vehicle's recorded data remains ongoing to identify the underlying cause,"" the official wrote.  The company did not respond to a call or email seeking further comment.  A similar sudden-braking episode in Utah last year left a 76-year-old state employee badly hurt. At the time, a company spokesman told the Deseret News that there was no indication the shuttle had malfunctioned. The vehicle was put back in service.  John Gleason, a spokesman for the Utah Department of Transportation, said no one ever determined what it was that the shuttle detected.  ""There were some theories that it could have been a large insect or something like that,"" he said.  Tom Dingus, the director of the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, has been leading the university's work involving EasyMile shuttles. Researchers there are interested in public perceptions of autonomous vehicles.  Dingus said people are willing to accept pretty high levels of risk when they are driving themselves, lulled by the feeling of being in control and an overestimation of their own skills. But take that feeling away, Dingus said, and people's tolerance for risk drops precipitously.  ""People are only going to accept fatalities in these systems that are in the range of 100 times lower than manual driving,"" he said.  Virginia Tech had run a simple shuttle service using an EasyMile vehicle last year, but the project ended, so current research will not be affected by NHTSA's order, Dingus said.  The Fairfax County project, which is envisioned as a shuttle between the Mosaic District, a mixed-use property development, and the Dunn Loring Metro station, has yet to launch. Robin Geiger, a spokeswoman for the county transportation department, said no start date has been set and that planning will continue during the suspension.  ian.duncan@washpost.com   CT 	 http://www.washingtonpost.com[http://www.washingtonpost.com]  RF 	 WP20200301shuttlesuspension0301  CO 	 nathg : National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  IN 	 iadrive : Autonomous Driving Technologies | iaut : Automotive | itech : Technology  NS 	 c26 : Product/Consumer Safety | c13 : Regulation/Government Policy | ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | cexpro : Products/Services | ncat : Content Types | nfact : Factiva Filters | nfcpin : C&E Industry News Filter  RE 	 usa : United States | usoh : Ohio | namz : North America | usc : Midwest U.S.  IPD 	 Development-Transportation  PUB 	 Washington Post",NA
"Document WP00000020200226eg2q0001i","A-Section","NTSB notes tech and driver failures in fatal 2018 Tesla crash","Michael Laris","1012 words","26 February 2020","The Washington Post","WP","FINAL","A02",NA,"English","Copyright 2020, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved","Both car and driver contributed to the 2018 crash of a Tesla in California that left a father of two dead, and federal regulators have shown a 'lack of leadership' in addressing safety problems with partly automated vehicles, investigators said Tuesday.  The investigation underscored questions about the safety and marketing of Tesla's 'Autopilot' system.","Robert L. Sumwalt III, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, pointed to a 'lack of system safeguards to prevent foreseeable misuses of technology.'  'Industry keeps implementing technology in such a way that people can get injured or killed,' Sumwalt said. 'If you own a car with partial automation, you do not own a self-driving car. Don't pretend that you do.'  The NTSB also cited 'shortfalls' in how the U.S. Transportation Department has overseen partial automation in cars made by Tesla and other manufacturers. NTSB officials said that although the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has numerous open investigations into Tesla vehicles, the regulator has been 'misguided, because it essentially relies on waiting for problems to occur rather than addressing safety issues proactively.'  NHTSA said it is reviewing the findings and has long recommended that technology developers use 'appropriate driver-vehicle interaction strategies in deployed technology' and has offered resources to make it easier for them to do so.  The March-23 crash that killed Walter Huang after he dropped off his son at preschool was one of 36,560 road deaths in the United States in 2018.  But it drew broad "" and, to Tesla, unwelcome "" attention to the company and potential problems with the high-end technology that is central to the Silicon Valley electric car pioneer's brand. After the crash, Tesla placed blame on Huang, an Apple engineer, saying 'the only way for this accident to have occurred is if Mr. Huang was not paying attention to the road.'  But days before Huang's Tesla drove off Highway-101 and into a barrier in Mountain View, the car's Autopilot had made a 'left steering movement toward' the same area, the NTSB found. Huang caught it in time, investigators said, and he told relatives the same problem had occurred in the same place multiple times before.  Despite that history, Huang was over-reliant on the Autopilot system, the NTSB found, noting that he used his iPhone-8 while behind the wheel and that a strategy game called 'Three Kingdoms' was 'active during his commute to work.'  The five-member NTSB board on Tuesday unanimously found that the crash was caused by 'system limitations' in Tesla's Autopilot feature, 'and the driver's lack of response due to distraction likely from a cellphone game application and overreliance on the Autopilot partial driving automation system.'  The NTSB also said Tesla's 'ineffective monitoring of driver engagement' "" it gauges the 'torque' a driver puts on the steering wheel as a proxy for whether the person is paying attention while using Autopilot "" also contributed to the crash and 'facilitated the driver's complacency.'  And it said Huang probably would not have been killed if California state transportation officials had repaired a crash 'attenuator' that was supposed to offer protection when a car hits a highway barrier; the attenuator had been struck earlier and was not yet fixed.  Tesla's collision avoidance systems 'were not designed to, and did not, detect the crash attenuator,' so there was no warning to Huang as his car headed toward the barrier and there was no automatic emergency braking, the NTSB said.  The car veered off the road 'due to limitations of the Tesla Autopilot vision system's processing software to accurately maintain the appropriate lane of travel,' the NTSB said. And the company did not address an earlier recommendation that it should restrict use of Autopilot to the particular conditions it is designed to handle, investigators said.  Tesla executives did not respond to questions about the technological problems or what has been done to fix them.  Among its recommendations, the NTSB called on NHTSA to evaluate whether Tesla's partly automated systems 'pose an unreasonable risk to safety' and to use NHTSA's 'applicable enforcement authority to ensure that Tesla Inc. takes corrective action' if they do. It also called on phone and other electronics manufacturers, including Apple, to install a 'lockout mechanism' that would, by default, disable distracting functions when a car is moving, among other measures.  Huang's crash was not the first time a Tesla driver was killed while using Autopilot, nor would it be the last, and NTSB officials voiced frustration because they said sufficient changes had not been made by the company and others.  In 2016, a speeding Tesla driver in Williston, Fla., crashed into a truck that turned in front of him. At the time, Tesla said 'neither Autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor-trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied.'  Musk later said that it was 'very likely' a new radar-based braking system would have prevented the crash.  In 2017, NHTSA said it found no defects in the Autopilot system in use at the time of that crash. The regulator's broader federal review of dozens of Autopilot crashes did point to industry-wide challenges.  'Many of the crashes appear to involve driver behavior factors, including traveling too fast for conditions, mode confusion, and distraction,' the investigators wrote. Mode confusion is the idea that it is unclear who is in control, the car or the driver, and occurred 'during attempted Autopilot activations' and 'after inadvertent overrides.'  In 2019, a driver using Autopilot in Delray Beach, Fla., crashed into a tractor-trailer that emerged from a private driveway and slowed in the middle of a highway, blocking the Tesla's path, the NTSB said.  Neither the Tesla driver nor the Autopilot system 'executed evasive maneuvers,' and the car's roof sheared off as it went under the truck, according to the NTSB.  michael.laris@washpost.com   CT 	 http://www.washingtonpost.com[http://www.washingtonpost.com]  RF 	 WP20200226NTSBtesla0226  CO 	 ntsbd : National Transportation Safety Board | usdot : United States Department of Transportation | teslmi : Tesla, Inc.

"Document WP00000020200212eg2c0002p","A-Section","Driver: Tesla kept veering in same spot","Michael Laris","772 words","12 February 2020","The Washington Post","WP","FINAL","A20",NA,"English","Copyright 2020, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved","Four days before Walter Huang's Tesla veered off U.S. 101 in Northern California and into a concrete barrier, killing the father of two, Huang sent a text message describing the car's 'Autopilot' system making a similar error in the same spot, according to documents released Tuesday by federal investigators.  Investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board, using data recorded by Huang's 2017 Tesla Model X, 'confirmed that the Tesla Autosteer system made a left steering movement toward' the area on March 19, 2018. Huang had his hands on the steering wheel at the time and 'made a right corrective steering movement' within one second, according to the NTSB.","Huang told relatives that his car had tried to steer off the road multiple times before in the same place, according to NTSB interviews. 'The family explained that it happened so often that he had told both his brother and his wife about the problem,' according to the NTSB.  But on March 23, after Huang dropped his son off at preschool and headed toward the office, he used his iPhone 8 while behind the wheel, according to the NTSB. Recovered phone logs show that a strategy game called 'Three Kingdoms' 'was active during the driver's trip to work,' the NTSB said. Investigators said the log data 'does not provide enough information to ascertain' whether Huang 'was holding the phone or how interactive he was,' though it said 'most players have both hands on the phone to support the device and manipulate game actions.' Huang's data usage was 'consistent' with online game activity 'about the time of the crash,' the NTSB said.  When Huang's Tesla SUV reached the exit ramp area in Mountain View, where he said the problems had previously occurred, the car again steered out of its lane and hit a barrier at about 71 miles per hour, according to the NTSB.  Tesla did not immediately respond Tuesday to questions about the Autopilot flaw Huang described or whether it had been fixed.  During the final minute of the trip, Huang's hands were detected on the steering 'on three separate occasions, for a total of 34 seconds,' the NTSB previously reported. For the six seconds before the crash, 'the vehicle did not detect the driver's hands on the steering wheel.' In its final seconds, the car also sped up from 62-miles per hour, investigators said.  Huang had Autopilot on for the last nearly 19 minutes before the crash, and the system detected that his hands were not on the wheel for 34-percent of that time, according to the newly released NTSB documents. The system gave him two 'visual alerts' and an audible one during that time, the documents say.  Tesla has faced sharp criticism from some lawmakers in Congress and elsewhere for calling its driver assistance features 'Autopilot,' which critics say is a clear overstatement of the system's capabilities that can encourage customers to let their guard down. The features are supposed to keep the car in its lane and apply the brakes in an emergency, but Tesla tells drivers they need to keep their hands on the wheel and stay in control of the vehicle.  Tesla, responding to questions from Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in December, provided data indicating that its customers who use Autopilot are significantly less likely to crash.  'Tesla takes the risk of improper use or abuse of Autopilot very seriously. Making sure the driver is attentive and able to take over at any time is a cornerstone of our feature development and validation, and something we continue to improve through fleet learning, customer feedback, and over-the-air ('OTA') updates,' the company wrote.  Federal investigators on Tuesday also released information on a second deadly crash, in 2019, as a driver used Autopilot in Delray Beach, Fla. In that crash, a tractor trailer drove out from a private driveway and slowed in the middle of a highway, blocking the Tesla's path, federal investigators said.  Neither the Tesla driver, Jeremy Banner, nor the Autopilot system 'executed evasive maneuvers,' and the car's roof sheared off as it drove under the truck, according to the NTSB.  The speed limit was 55-mph. Banner set the 'Traffic Aware Cruise Control,' part of Autopilot, at 69-mph about 12 seconds before the crash, investigators said. He activated 'Autosteer' about 10 seconds before the crash. His hands were not detected on the wheel during final 7.7-seconds before impact, the NTSB said.  michael.laris@washpost.com   CT 	 http://www.washingtonpost.com[http://www.washingtonpost.com]  RF 	 WP20200212NTSBTESLA  CO 	 ntsbd : National Transportation Safety Board  NS 	 gtacc : Transport Accidents | gcat : Political/General News | gdis : Disasters/Accidents | gmmdis : Accidents/Man-made Disasters | gtrans : Transport  RE 	 usa : United States | namz : North America  IPD 	 Local  PUB 	 Washington Post",NA
"Document J000000020230227ej2r0000r",NA,"Inside View: How ChatGPT Will Become Useful","By Andy Kessler","846 words","27 February 2023","The Wall Street Journal","J",NA,"A15",NA,"English","Copyright 2023 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.","In the rudimentary days of videogames, I met the team that created the first multiplayer Formula 1 Grand Prix racing game. They had to alter the original code because they discovered almost every player at the start of the first race would turn his car around on the track and crash into the incoming traffic. I started to laugh, because that's what I did too. Gives new meaning to the Facebook motto: Move fast and break things.  That's exactly what's going on with the newfangled generative AI chatbots. Everyone's trying to break them and show their limitations and downsides. It's human nature. A New York Times reporter was ""thoroughly creeped out"" after using Microsoft Bing's chatbot. Sounds as if someone needs reassignment to the society pages. In 2016 Microsoft had to shut down its experimental chatbot, Tay, after users turned it into what some called a ""neo-Nazi sexbot.""","Coders can't test for everything, so they need thousands or millions banging away to find their flaws. Free testers. In the coming months, you're going to hear a lot more about RLHF, reinforced learning from human feedback. Machine-learning systems scan large quantities of data on the internet but then learn by chatting with actual humans in a feedback loop to hone their skills.  Unfortunately, some people are ruder than others. This is what destroyed Tay. So ChatGPT currently limits its human feedback training to paid contractors. That will eventually change. Windows wasn't ready until version 3.0; generative AI will get there too.  For now Microsoft's solution is to limit users to six questions a session for the Bing chatbot, effectively giving each session an expiration date. This sounds eerily similar to the Tyrell Corporation's Nexus-6 replicants from the 1982 movie ""Blade Runner."" If I remember, that didn't end well.  Every time something new comes out, lots of people try to break it or foolishly try to find the edge, like jumping into the back seat of a self-driving Tesla. This is especially scary given the recent recall of 362,800 Teslas with faulty ""Full Self-Driving"" software. And, reminiscent of the ""Can I confess something?"" scene in ""Annie Hall,"" I've always wondered: If I drove my car straight into a brick wall, would the collision avoidance actually work? I'm too chicken to try.  Every cyberattack is a lesson in breakage, like the 2015 hack of the Office of Personnel Management or the May 2021 ransomware shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline. Heck, Elon Musk's X.com and Peter Thiel's PayPal payment processors were initially so riddled with fraud that the media insisted e-commerce would never happen, naysaying what today is a $10 trillion business. Looking back, they were lucky they were attacked at an early stage when the stakes were much lower.  But be warned that with generative AI, even if it's too early, if developers can build something, they will. So best to shake out all the bugs and limitations and creep reporters out now before things roll out to the masses.  Despite early glitches, useful things are coming. Search boxes aren't very conversational. Using them is like grunting words to zero in on something you suspect exists. Now a more natural human interface can replace back-and-forth conversations with old-fashioned travel agents. Or stockbrokers. Or doctors.  Once conversations are human enough, the Eleanor Rigby floodgates -- Ah, look at all the lonely people -- will open. Eldercare may be the first big generative AI hit. Instead of grandma talking to the TV, a chatbot can stand in. Remember the 2013 movie ""Her,"" with Joaquin Phoenix's character falling in love with an online bot voiced by Scarlett Johansson? This will become reality soon, no question. Someone will build it and against all warnings, millions will use it. In fact, the aptly named Replika AI Companion has launched, although its programmers quickly turned off the ""erotic roleplay"" feature. Hmmm.  It may take longer for ""M3GAN,"" this year's movie thriller (I watched it as a comedy) to become reality. It's about a robot companion for a child gone rogue. But products like this will happen. Mattel's 2015 Hello Barbie, which would listen and talk to kids, eventually failed, but someone will get it right before long.  The trick is not to focus on the downside, like so many do with DNA crime-solving or facial-recognition systems or even the idea that Russian ads on social networks can tip elections. Let's face it, every new technology is the Full Employment Act for ethicists -- and scolds. Instead, with generative AI, focus on the upside of conversational search, companions for the lonely, and eventually an education system custom tailored to each student. Each time, crowds will move fast and try to break things and expose the flaws. Embrace that as part of the path to the future.  ---  Write to kessler@wsj.com   NS 	 gaiml : Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning | gmora : Motor Racing | nedc : Commentaries/Opinions | gcat : Political/General News | gcsci : Computer Science | gmoto : Motor Sports | gsci : Sciences/Humanities | gspo : Sports | ncat : Content Types | nfact : Factiva Filters | nfce : C&E Exclusion Filter | nfcpex : C&E Executive News Filter | nrgn : Routine General News  RE 	 usa : United States | namz : North America  IPC 	 NND | EDP  PUB 	 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.",NA

Earlier this month, a train carrying hazardous materials derailed in the village of East Palestine, causing a chemical fire and prompting officials to tell thousands to evacuate. At a press conference Tuesday, state environmental and health officials said the controlled release of chemicals affected local waterways, causing the death of about 3,500 fish. Another Norfolk Southern train derailed on Thursday in Michigan, and authorities said there was no evidence of exposed hazardous materials. Norfolk shares lost 1.8% Tuesday.  COCA-COLA CO.  KO -1.7%  Coca-Cola wants to energize its sluggish sports-drink sales. Chief Executive James Quincey said Tuesday that sales of its BodyArmor brand declined in the latest quarter, as the soda giant integrated BodyArmor with Powerade, Coke's other sports drink. Coke paid $5.6 billion to buy the fast-growing Gatorade competitor in 2021, but Coke and other beverage companies have struggled with startup brands after spending big to acquire them. Coca-Cola's turnaround plan for its sports drinks includes new marketing campaigns set to begin in a few weeks for both BodyArmor and Powerade. Coca-Cola shares fell 1.7% Tuesday.  AIRBNB INC.  ABNB +13%  The travel industry is continuing its Covid-19 recovery. Airbnb posted earnings of $1.9 billion in 2022 -- its first annual profit -- as the short-term rental company benefited from strong travel demand. Hotel operator Marriott International Inc.'s fourth-quarter results topped Wall Street's expectations as revenue rose by a third, and online travel site TripAdvisor Inc. posted a surge in revenue as well. Airbnb shares soared 13% Wednesday.  TAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING CO.  TSM -5.3%  The Oracle of Omaha is shedding shares of TSMC. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. cut its stake in the chip maker by 51.8 million shares, or roughly 86%, in the fourth quarter. The sale comes just months after Berkshire disclosed its stake, an uncharacteristic reversal for a firm that has held many of its large investments for years. The prospect of an economic downturn, along with higher inflation and reduced demand for consumer electronics, has weighed on the outlooks of chip manufacturers. American depositary shares of TSMC fell 5.3% Wednesday.  TESLA INC.  TSLA -5.7%  Tesla is putting the brakes on some self-driving vehicles. The electric-car maker is recalling 362,800 vehicles equipped with its Full Self-Driving Beta feature in response to regulatory pressure, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Thursday. The top U.S. car-safety agency said some Teslas in rare circumstances could violate local traffic laws, potentially increasing collision risk if a driver fails to intervene. Recalls typically require car owners to visit a mechanic to have a fix made, but Tesla will update the vehicles' software remotely. Tesla shares lost 5.7% Thursday.  ROKU INC.  ROKU +11%  Signs of life in the ad market helped revive Roku's battered stock. The streaming-device giant on Wednesday said the advertising market was muted in the fourth quarter but noted improvements in ad spending among companies in the restaurant, travel, packaged-goods and wellness sectors. The weak ad market has weighed on other firms' quarterly results, including Google parent Alphabet Inc. Roku also said that operating expenses, which grew by 68% last year, would grow at a slower pace in 2023. In the recent quarter, the company laid off about 200 employees. Roku shares rose 11% Thursday.  CISCO SYSTEMS INC.  CSCO +5.2%  Cisco was a bright spot amid a recent tech slump. The networking-equipment company raised its outlook for the year after posting better-than-expected results late Wednesday. The results contrast with those of other tech firms that have reported slower growth as they face inflation and economic uncertainty. Companies across most sectors, but particularly those in tech, have cut jobs as a result. Microsoft Corp. last month posted its slowest quarterly sales growth in more than six years, while Salesforce Inc. warned of stumbling sales. Cisco shares gained 5.2% Thursday.

"Document J000000020230217ej2h0002l",NA,"Automation Feature Spurs Tesla Recall","By Ryan Felton","840 words","17 February 2023","The Wall Street Journal","J",NA,"B1",NA,"English","Copyright 2023 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.","Tesla Inc. is recalling 362,800 vehicles equipped with its high-profile advanced-driver assistance feature, a technology marketed as Full Self-Driving Beta, in response to regulatory pressure, the U.S. top car-safety agency said.  In a notice published Thursday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that some Teslas in rare circumstances could violate local traffic laws, potentially increasing the risk of a collision if a driver fails to intervene.","NHTSA, the auto industry's main regulator, said it told Tesla last month about potential concerns related to characteristics of the system specific to certain roadway environments, such as traveling through intersections during a stale yellow light and adjusting the vehicle's speed while traveling through certain variable speed zones.  As of this week, Tesla had identified 18 warranty claims potentially related to the conditions above, and it isn't aware of any injuries or deaths related to those situations, the notice said.  Tesla said it would deploy an over-the-air software update in the coming weeks to improve how the technology negotiates certain driving maneuvers during the relevant conditions, according to the filing.  Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment.  Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted: ""The word 'recall' for an over-the-air software update is anachronistic and just flat wrong!""  Recalls typically require car owners to take their vehicles to a mechanic to have a fix made. Tesla can update vehicle software remotely.  According to the NHTSA filing, Tesla didn't initially concur with the agency's findings but decided on Feb. 7 to administer a voluntary recall out of an abundance of caution.  The recall campaign represents one of the most forceful regulatory actions yet on Tesla's efforts to automate its vehicles, a strategy that has been a revenue opportunity for the auto maker and is key to its vision of eventually replacing drivers with robots.  Tesla's shares ended down 5.7% on Thursday.  Regulators have long been looking into Tesla's driver-assistance systems amid high-profile crashes and questions about whether the company was promising more than it could deliver and whether users were in jeopardy from misuse. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission have also been investigating whether Tesla misled consumers about how Autopilot performed.  Mr. Musk has vocally defended his offerings, suggesting it would be unethical to not put such technology on the roadways to improve safety.  Despite the name, Full Self-Driving doesn't make cars fully autonomous, and Tesla instructs drivers to remain alert, with their hands on the wheel.  Autopilot can handle driving tasks on the highway, such as steering and adjusting speed. Full Self-Driving Beta, which Tesla charges customers $15,000 to buy, adds functionality beyond Autopilot and expands the areas and situations in which drivers can use the assistance features, allowing for navigation on city streets.  The software is available to any Tesla owner who buys the hardware and software suite of features needed for it, the company says.  The recall covers 2016-2023 Tesla Model S and Model X vehicles, 2017-2023 Model 3 sedans and 2020-2023 Model Y SUVs.  In the past, Tesla has said driving with Autopilot engaged is safer than driving without it. It also has cited its own data showing that crashes were less common when drivers were using Autopilot, though some researchers have criticized Tesla's methodology.  NHTSA has been examining Tesla's driver-assistance systems since mid-2021, when it opened a probe into a series of crashes in which Tesla vehicles using Autopilot struck first-responder vehicles stopped for roadway emergencies.  NHTSA said in a statement that it would continue to monitor the recall remedies Tesla issues for effectiveness. The recall doesn't address the full scope of NHTSA's investigation, which the agency said remains open and active.  The auto regulator last year said it was upgrading its investigation into the emergency-vehicle crashes to an engineering analysis after identifying new crashes involving Autopilot. The upgrade is a critical step for determining whether to order a safety recall. In doing so, NHTSA also said it has expanded its examination of Autopilot to include a wider range of crashes, not only those at emergency scenes.  The agency said it would further assess how drivers interact with Autopilot and the degree to which it might reduce motorists' attentiveness.  Jennifer Homendy, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board, last year said Tesla shouldn't roll out the city-driving tool before addressing what the agency views as safety deficiencies in the company's technology. The NTSB, which investigates crashes and issues safety recommendations though it has no regulatory authority, has urged Tesla to clamp down on how drivers are able to use the company's driver-assistance tools.  NHTSA said that testing performed by agency staff on vehicles equipped with Tesla's advanced driver-assistance system was pivotal to its understanding of how the tech performed on the roads.

All Rights Reserved.","Federal safety officials said excessive speed and the driver's failure to control the car likely caused the fatal crash of a Tesla Inc. vehicle in Texas nearly two years ago.  The National Transportation Safety Board said in a report released Wednesday that evidence indicated that the driver of a Tesla Model S hadn't engaged any of Tesla's advanced driver-assistance features before crashing north of Houston in April 2021. The car's two occupants died.","Initially, a local constable said he believed the Model S had been operating without anyone in the driver's seat when it crashed into a tree. One of the men was found in the front passenger's seat, and the other in the back seat of the car, according to authorities.  ""Although the driver's seat was found vacant and the driver was found in the left rear seat, the available evidence suggests that the driver was seated in the driver's seat at the time of the crash and moved into the rear seat postcrash,"" said the NTSB, which investigates crashes and issues safety recommendations.  Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment.  The NTSB's report echoed the agency's preliminary findings, which raised doubts that Tesla's advanced driver-assistance system known as Autopilot was involved in the crash. The NTSB said in its latest update that the driver accelerated to 67 miles an hour on a residential street where the speed limit was 30 miles an hour, resulting in a loss of control. A toxicology report showed that the driver's blood-alcohol concentration was nearly twice the legal limit in Texas, the agency said.

"Document J000000020220930ei9u0001s",NA,"Porsche Shares Stall in Trading Debut --- Initial rise loses steam, falls short of forecast, prompting selloff of parent company VW","By Ben Dummett and Patricia Kowsmann","1105 words","30 September 2022","The Wall Street Journal","J",NA,"B1",NA,"English","Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.","Porsche AG shares lost much of their luster on their first day of trading in Frankfurt, showing the struggles that even an iconic luxury car faces from the gloomy economic outlook and volatility that have weighed on markets.  After pricing its initial public offer late Wednesday at the top of the target range in Europe's largest IPO for over a decade, Porsche ended flat. The muted trading performance suggests the company may have priced the issue too aggressively. Typically a company tries to price a new issue at a level that maximizes sale proceeds but also ensures a rise in the stock price on the first day of trading.","After the stock began trading on Thursday, they rose close to 5%, but began losing gains through the session. They ended at 82.50 euros in line with the IPO price. That gave the German-based company a market value of more than 75 billion euros, equivalent to more than $73 billion.  Still, that level puts Porsche among the top five biggest car markers measured by market value, behind its parent company Volkswagen AG, which retains a 75% stake, but ahead of German rival Mercedes-Benz Group AG. Tesla Inc.'s valuation of more than $886 billion leads the way, followed by Japan's Toyota Motor Corp.  Volkswagen preferred shares closed down by almost 7% in Frankfurt Thursday. Some investors had bought the stock ahead of Porsche's trading debut, betting it would jump with the expected 10% gain in Porsche's stock. But that didn't come close to happening, prompting the VW investors to sell their shares, particularly given the overall market decline and weakness in other major European car stocks, investors said.  Still, Porsche's ability to carry off the new listing stands out in an otherwise downbeat global market for initial public offerings. The total value of IPOs is down 70% globally to $135 billion so far in 2022 from the comparable period last year, according to data from Dealogic. Activity has suffered from a combination of equity volatility that makes valuing companies more challenging and the poor performance of recently listed companies.  Ahead of the IPO, some market participants suggested the stock could rise 10% or more on its debut. But worries over economic growth, rising bond yields and the recent instability in the U.K. dented some of the excitement.  Major stock indexes across Europe were all lower Thursday, including an almost 1% drop in Germany's DAX blue-chip benchmark. Also, many investors who only received a tiny allocation in the IPO decided to sell their shares after the expected early surge failed to materialize, said Alastair Mankin, a trader at brokerage firm Cowen Inc.  The deal comes as Volkswagen faces the prospect of slowing demand for its cars because of the risk of a global recession. The IPO will provide the manufacturer with crucial proceeds to help finance its aggressive push into electric vehicles, the development of new technology such as self-driving cars and the creation of a new business building batteries for its EVs.  Car companies are under pressure to invest billions into the development of electric vehicles and battery factories, investments spurred on by stricter tailpipe-emissions rules and Tesla's meteoric rise.  ""These proceeds are really for investing even more powerfully into the future of digitization and electrification,"" said Arno Antlitz, Volkswagen's chief financial officer, adding that the company is investing in its own battery technology, which will require several billions in funding. Volkswagen will potentially offer an IPO for that business in the future, Mr. Antlitz said.  The IPO was in part designed to give the heirs of the Porsche family some control back over the car maker after Porsche, then independent, failed to acquire VW more than a decade ago. The complex offering, which includes the private placement of voting shares to the family separate from the IPO, gives the members sufficient power to block any major strategic decisions by VW that they oppose.  At the same time, the offering shines a light on Porsche's value, while giving it greater independence to pursue its own electric-vehicle strategy.  With the launch of the all-electric Taycan in 2019, Porsche began moving into electric vehicles, which the company says will account for 80% of new car sales by 2030. Last year, the Taycan passed Porsche's iconic 911 sports car in sales and became the company's third-best-selling model after the Macan and Cayenne sport-utility vehicles.  Porsche Chief Executive Officer Oliver Blume said in an interview that the company ""has shown a resilient business model especially in times of crisis."" The past three years have been marked by the pandemic, semiconductor shortages and now the Ukraine crisis, but during that time ""we have shown very high profit margins,"" he added.  The company posted revenue of 33.1 billion euros last year, generating a return on sales of 16%. That was up from 9.7% during the financial crisis in 2009. Meanwhile, annual car deliveries roughly tripled over that time to more than 300,000, according to the offering prospectus.  Porsche's rich customer base, which is able to more easily absorb rising prices and a general economic slowdown, offers it some protection against a downturn in demand.  In addition to his role at Porsche, Mr. Blume is VW's chief executive. Some analysts have said Mr. Blume's twin responsibilities could make it harder for him to give Porsche the focus it will need as a more independent company.  Compared with the overall size of Porsche, the IPO was relatively small. Volkswagen sold 12.5% of Porsche's stock in the form of nonvoting preferred shares in the offering, but as of Monday investors had already been told that orders had exceeded the available shares at 82.50 euros or the high end of the targeted range.  VW said that it expects to receive up to 9.4 billion euros in proceeds from the IPO, making it Europe's largest since the $10 billion offering by Glencore PLC in 2011. It is also raising another 10.1 billion euros from a separate private placement of voting shares to Porsche SE, VW's largest shareholder and the listed investment fund majority-owned by the heirs of the brand's founder, for a total of almost 20 billion euros. Almost 50% of the funds will be distributed to VW shareholders in a special dividend.

"Document J000000020220820ei8k00016",NA,"EXCHANGE --- Business News: Tesla Asked About Autopilot Camera --- NHTSA requests more details about driver- assistance technology amid probe of crashes","By Joseph De Avila","508 words","20 August 2022","The Wall Street Journal","J",NA,"B3",NA,"English","Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.","U.S. auto-safety regulators are asking Tesla Inc. for information related to its cabin-camera system as part of an investigation into crashes involving its driver-assistance technology.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sent a nine-page letter to Tesla on Thursday asking questions about its vehicles, including what role the cabin-camera system plays in driver-engagement alerts and timing.","The agency is also asking the electric-car maker to identify each lawsuit filed against Tesla where the plaintiff alleges the crash was affected by the vehicle's hardware and software systems.  NHTSA asked Tesla to describe in detail the engineering and safety measures that went into design decisions for Autopilot, its driver-assistance technology.  Tesla must respond to a set of the requests by Sept. 19, the agency said. One additional reply is due Oct. 12.  Tesla didn't respond to a request to comment Friday.  The electric-car maker has long maintained that driving with Autopilot engaged is safer than doing so without it. Tesla points to internal data showing that crashes were less common when drivers were using Autopilot. Some researchers have criticized Tesla's methodology.  Autopilot is designed to help drivers steer and keep an appropriate distance from other cars. The driver-assistance system tells motorists to pay attention to the road and keep their hands on the wheel.  NHTSA in June expanded its probe into a series of crashes in which Tesla vehicles using Autopilot struck first-responder vehicles stopped for roadway emergencies. The agency said it was upgrading its earlier investigation, which began in August 2021, after identifying new crashes involving Autopilot and emergency-response vehicles.  NHTSA said last August that it had found 11 incidents since early 2018 in which a Tesla vehicle using Autopilot struck one or more vehicles involved in an emergency situation. In June, the NHTSA said it identified six additional collisions.  The agency has expanded its probe of Autopilot to include crashes that didn't occur at emergency scenes.  NHTSA's probe into the crashes will determine whether it will order a safety recall. Car makers are required to recall their vehicles if a safety defect is discovered.  Tesla recalled about 135,000 Model S and Model X vehicles in the U.S. in 2021 due to touch-screen failures. Tesla said at the time that it disputed that the issue was because of a defect but recalled the cars in the interest of customer experience.  Tesla also recalled more than 285,000 vehicles in China in 2021 because of a cruise-control-related safety issue. China's State Administration for Market Regulation said the auto maker's cruise-control system could be activated accidentally, potentially leading to sudden acceleration. Tesla apologized and said it would improve safety in line with national requirements.  Shares of Tesla declined 2% to $890 in Friday trading. The shares are down about 16% year to date.

"Document J000000020220806ei860000c",NA,"OFF DUTY --- Gear & Gadgets -- Rumble Seat: Can the New Chevy Bolt EUV Win Back America's Trust?","By Dan Neil","1197 words","6 August 2022","The Wall Street Journal","J",NA,"D10",NA,"English","Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.","Although it sounds like something to do with old guys and Corvettes, ""pathetic fallacy"" is a term from literary criticism: the use of personification to achieve easy emotional effects. The door yawned and beckoned, and so forth.  As critic Northrop Frye might have observed, personification is lame.","But I couldn't help myself. As I watched neighbors and dog-walkers peer hungrily through the windows of the 2022 Chevrolet Bolt EUV -- a slightly huskier version of the refreshed Bolt EV, now with less flammable batteries -- I quietly hoped it was enjoying the attention. That little bugger has been through some things.  Debuting for model-year 2017, the Bolt (midsize four-door hatchback) was GM's first mass-produced, long-range EV, the younger sibling to the Volt plug-in hybrid. With well-equipped models priced under $40,000 (including the $7,500 federal tax credit then available) and a reliable 200 miles of range between charges, the Bolt was a peppy paragon of appropriateness. All of Vulcan rejoiced.  In retrospect, it's clear GM's enthusiasm for EVs was not quite there yet: Marketing didn't support the Bolt; manufacturing didn't scale to meet demand; and sales/service were like, What? No. We need Silverados.  And then came the battery fires. After two years of headlines about fleetwide recalls and Do Not Drive orders, I figured the only tire-kickers would be pyromaniacs. But look at all these nice people. It's amazing what $5 a gallon gas has done for the little Chevy's sex appeal.  The cause of the fires was determined to be a glitch in the manufacturing of the pouch-style cells by supplier LG Chem. The problem was identified and remedied, with the fix being baked into the battery modules for new cars and those replacing recalled units. The new packs, assembled in Michigan, are limited-warrantied for eight years and 100,000 miles.  GM seemed to have handled the recall well. Repairing the Bolt's image will be harder.  Look, I've got no one to talk to. I'm reduced to spying on my neighbors from behind the drapes like Mrs. Kravitz. Can I just share? The Bolt battery fires absolutely floored me. One of the core assumptions of GM's electrification program was the superior safety and manufacturability of pouch-style, lithium-ion cells, as opposed cylindrical cells or those with other form factors.  For example: The way in which these cells -- looking a bit like Pop-Tarts' foil bags -- gang together in racks, then packs, requires fewer connections than cylindrical cells. Better, safer. The flat shape also offers more surface area for battery cooling; and preventing thermal runaway -- ignition -- is the most important thing. Just ask GM's in-house counsel.  In this way, safety would have seemed to play a determinative role in GM's use of such cells, even though they offer somewhat lower energy density compared to Tesla-typical cylindrical cells.  After this abundance of strategic caution, the LG Chem failure seemed unfair to GM and potentially misleading to consumers regarding the safety of EVs generally, since this technology is ubiquitous. Anyway, I'm confident the new Bolt, with battery 2.0, is super-duper safe.  When Bolt production resumed it included the model variant seen here, the EUV, which stands for ""electric utility vehicle."" Here's where I could use an ""eye roll"" emoji. While the EUV's wheelbase is 2.9 inches longer and overall length stretched 6.3 inches, those inches don't meaningfully add to the interior utility. I'm not sure what they do, frankly.  Behind that molded-plastic face mask, the EUV is largely identical to the Bolt EV, itself emerged from a mid-cycle refresh with lots of desirable upgrades. Window-peepers have seen the overhauled and updated cabin focused on the easy and effortless touch screen UX, including Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Yes on wireless charging, yes on availability of GM's advanced driver-assistance system, called Super Cruise.  According to owners of first-Gen models, the new driver's seat is much more comfortable. I have to take their word for it; my butt's memory ain't what it used to be.  Under the hood is a 150 kW/360 Nm (200hp/266 lb-ft) permanent-magnet motor, offering plenty of swoosh as well as progressive levels of regenerative braking -- a little or a lot, up to one-pedal control -- activated via paddles on the backside of the steering wheel. There's also a dedicated switch in the center console to activate one-pedal mode. Bolts remain front-drive only, with no AWD option.  If, from a dead stop, you stand on the Go pedal, the EUV can scoot to 60 mph between 7-8 seconds, thereabouts and depending. The torque across the front axle can easily exceed the grip of the low-rolling-resistance tires, which makes it a bit of a squealer.  Even so, the Bolt EUV feels game and nimble, cheap and cheerful, with easy handling and a minimum of body roll while cornering, owing to the low-slung center of mass. Ride quality is good; interior noise level is just OK. It doesn't seem like much of the 3,679-pound curb weight was devoted to soundproofing materials.  In some ways, the Bolt is legacy-EV already. Back home in Detroit, all the sexy talk is about GM's Ultium platform, 320-mile Blazer EV crossovers and a Cadillac EV super sedan that will reportedly cost 300,000.  And yet this workaday EV everycar -- with a brand name up there with Ford Pinto in the category ""famously flammable"" -- seems to have acquired an unexpected, exquisite relevance, even desirability, despite its limitations as a sex machine.  The range is what it is -- figure 200 miles between charges, just to be safe. A full charge at home (240 V) takes 7 hours, so overnight. GM has defended the Bolt's smallish 65-kWh battery as an optimization of cost vs. utility: Why should consumers pay for longer range when research shows they will never use it? Of course, that rationale depends on home charging, which in the past has been left to consumers to arrange.  No more. Get this: With every Bolt purchased, the company will provide free standard-type Level 2 charging equipment and home installation, where available.

"Document J000000020220618ei6i0001f",NA,"EXCHANGE --- Keywords: Self-Driving Trucks Are Just Around the Bend --- Big rigs will become truly autonomous before cars, but are still years from having a major impact on how we transport goods","By Christopher Mims","1606 words","18 June 2022","The Wall Street Journal","J",NA,"B2",NA,"English","Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.","Some day in the next few years, if you're on the right stretch of highway in America's Sunbelt, you are likely to have the disconcerting experience of pulling alongside a fully loaded semi truck, glancing at the cab, and seeing no one behind the wheel at all.  Unless you look closely, the truck you're likely to see will look very much like a regular big rig. It will still have a steering wheel -- twitching, as if moved by ghostly hands. It will also have those oversize rearview mirrors trucks have, only these will be even more exaggerated in scale, since they will double as mounts for sensors -- including radar, lidar, and cameras -- that help the truck see things even an experienced human driver might miss.","This truck won't be as smart or adaptable as a human, but it will have superhuman senses, and won't need to rest. What's more, it won't be susceptible to many of the pitfalls that have made autonomy in passenger vehicles largely a disappointment, with companies blowing past one self-imposed deadline after another. While the self-driving passenger-vehicle industry struggles to gain traction despite decades and tens of billions of dollars in investment, proponents of self-driving trucks say they could be here -- and making money for their operators -- much sooner.  Some of the companies involved say they will have the first trucks without drivers in the cab on America's highways by the end of next year. Those include Aurora, which has partnerships with FedEx and Werner Enterprises, and TuSimple, which has joined up with UPS and Ryder.  When it gains widespread traction, robot trucking will have big implications for how we move goods around America -- and for the companies and people involved in that process. For starters, it could help alleviate a chronic shortage of drivers, who are retiring faster than they can be replaced, leading to what the American Trucking Associations claims is a historic shortage of 80,000 drivers.  Here's the promise of robot trucks: While full self-driving in all conditions is still a pipe dream, engineers seem to be close to achieving it in limited circumstances, such as on highways on clear days. And highway driving, in good weather, happens to be exactly the context in which long-haul trucks operate for a substantial portion of the time.  One reason for that: Highways are what Aurora Chief Executive Chris Urmson calls self-similar.  ""A bit of freeway in Texas looks very much like a bit of freeway in Phoenix or Minnesota,"" says Mr. Urmson, a former faculty member at Carnegie Mellon University and Google executive who co-founded Aurora in 2017. The similarity is good for the artificial-intelligence technology that underpins self-driving, which can be great at handling things it has seen before, and terrible at adapting to situations that are novel. Anyone who has tried GM's Super Cruise, Nissan's ProPilot Assist, or Tesla's Autopilot system has experienced this firsthand.  Highways also have the virtue of being relatively free of pedestrians, bicyclists, animals and children chasing after balls, and they tend to be well-marked and well-maintained.  Highways in Southwestern states, where the weather is generally good, are where autonomous trucking companies are currently testing their systems, carrying real loads for actual clients like FedEx and UPS, albeit with safety drivers behind the wheel in case the AI systems make a mistake -- which they still do.  So, in good weather, a robot truck will see farther than a person can. It will never grow drowsy or inattentive. It will be able to operate 24 hours a day, stopping only for fuel and maintenance.  Now, there are also reasons to discount claims about commercial autonomous trucking happening in the next couple of years, or making a big difference anytime soon.  For one, the younger companies trying to pioneer the technology have to sustain the interest of investors until they start making money.  And that could be a while: Aurora, for example, has said that it will lose money until 2027. Chief Financial Officer Richard Tame said the company has enough cash to fund operations through the introduction of its first autonomous truck next year and into 2024. The company has said in public filings that it expects it will eventually need to raise additional capital.  Even if startups do get their trucks rolling on schedule, it could take a while to have a real impact. By the end of 2023, Aurora will be putting ""on the order of dozens"" of driver-free trucks on America's highways, says Sterling Anderson, the company's chief product officer.  TuSimple also aims to have a fully autonomous commercial-trucking service operating in the U.S. by the end of 2023, says CEO Xiaodi Hou. In the meantime, the company also plans to begin delivering freight for Union Pacific with fully autonomous trucks, says a company spokesman.  Compared with the total number of large trucks rolling in America today -- nearly four million, half of them the type that haul freight long distance -- the scant dozens of self-driving trucks projected to be on the road by the end of 2023 would be a drop in the ocean.  Waymo -- which, as a unit of Google parent Alphabet, has less pressing concerns about funding -- is less aggressive in its prediction for the arrival of robo-rigs. Its trucking-focused arm, Waymo Via, hasn't set a date for its trucks to operate with no human in the cab, despite having already entered partnerships with trucking companies C.H. Robinson and J.B. Hunt and truck maker Daimler Truck, among others. Waymo has many reasons for that reticence, says Charlie Jatt, its head of commercialization for trucking. An important one is that there is no production-ready, commercially available truck with the redundant control systems that a self-driving system would require.  If power steering goes out in a human-controlled vehicle, a driver could still potentially muscle it to the side of the road. But with no human in the cab, an autonomous vehicle must have backup steering, braking and electrical systems, says Mr. Jatt. Getting all of these into trucks that can be made not just one at a time but by the tens of thousands is why Waymo has joined with Daimler Truck, he adds.  Indeed, everyone I interviewed for this piece, except for TuSimple, said that the potential for their systems to make mistakes is the reason they haven't rolled them out yet -- even those who claim to be close to doing so. (A recent report from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration listed more than 100 accidents involving vehicles equipped with autonomous driving systems over the past year.)  Still, the potential financial benefits of robo-trucking technology are so enormous that shippers and trucking companies are likely to embrace it as soon as they feel it is ready.  Adding even $20,000 of hardware, in the form of additional sensors and powerful computers, to a long-haul truck is quickly offset by the elimination of labor costs, which typically represent 15% to 20% of the cost of operating a truck. Another big economic impact is that by law a human driving a truck must stop and rest. That means every truck, which can cost between $100,000 and $200,000, is being used only about 30% to 40% of the time. Just running them 24 hours, stopping only for fuel and maintenance, increases their utilization by a factor of two or more.  Regulations are hardly a barrier to rolling out autonomous trucks. NHTSA has created suggested guidelines, which most states have adopted. These call for companies to, in essence, self-regulate. ""A small handful of states have certain certifications or prohibitions, but all the rest are open for business,"" says Aurora's Mr. Anderson.  Autonomous-truck companies like his have for the most part moved on to validating their tech, rather than continuing to build it, says Don Burnette, CEO of Kodiak Robotics, another self-driving trucking startup. That's why, for the industry as a whole, deployment of safe, commercially viable, fully autonomous trucks is just a couple of years away, he adds.  Longer term, robot trucks could go from driver-shortage solution to driver-job killer.  As self-driving trucks become more capable, and can perform most of the driving on long trips throughout most of America, they could ultimately threaten nearly all the roughly 500,000 long-haul trucking jobs in the U.S.  It's worth noting that existing long-haul trucking jobs are already a far cry from the solid middle-class gigs they were in the 1970s, before deregulation of the trucking industry, says Steve Viscelli, an expert in the trucking industry at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the industry advisory council at Aurora. He believes self-driving trucks will continue what has been a decadeslong transformation of the industry.  ""I think after that the pace of adoption could be significantly faster than people expect, over the following decade,"" says Dr. Viscelli. ""These trucks are going to have different capabilities than a human-driven truck will have, so they will not be used in the way a human-driven truck will be used -- in the same way a hundred guys with shovels are not an excavator.""

"Document J000000020220610ei6a00029",NA,"Probe of Tesla Crashes Expands --- Road-safety agency to perform engineering analysis of car maker's Autopilot feature","By Ryan Felton","731 words","10 June 2022","The Wall Street Journal","J",NA,"B1",NA,"English","Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.","U.S. auto-safety regulators have escalated their investigation into emergency-scene crashes involving Tesla Inc.'s Autopilot, a critical step for determining whether to order a safety recall.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a notice published Thursday that it was expanding a probe begun last August into a series of crashes in which Tesla vehicles using Autopilot struck first-responder vehicles stopped for road emergencies.","The agency said it was upgrading its earlier investigation to an engineering analysis after identifying new crashes involving Autopilot and emergency-response vehicles.  NHTSA also said it has expanded its examination of Autopilot to include a wider range of crashes, not only those at emergency scenes. The agency said it would further assess how drivers interact with Autopilot and the degree to which it might reduce motorists' attentiveness.  Forensic data available for 11 of the crashes showed that drivers failed to take evasive action in the two to five seconds before the collision, the agency said.  The investigation covers an estimated 830,000 Tesla vehicles made from 2014 to 2021, including the Model 3, Model S, Model X and Model Y.  NHTSA said in its filing that it has identified 15 injuries and one fatality related to the crashes.  Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment. The electric-car maker's stock fell just under 1% to $719.12 on Thursday.  Autopilot, Tesla's name for the advanced driver-assistance technology used in its vehicles, is designed to help drivers with tasks such as steering and keeping a safe distance from other vehicles. Tesla instructs drivers using the system to pay attention to the road and keep their hands on the wheel.  The electric-car maker has long maintained that driving with Autopilot engaged is safer than doing so without it. Tesla points to internal data showing that crashes were less common when drivers were using Autopilot. Some researchers have criticized Tesla's methodology.  In opening its initial probe last year, NHTSA said that it had identified 11 crashes since early 2018 in which a Tesla vehicle using Autopilot struck one or more vehicles involved in an emergency-response situation. In its latest filing, the agency said it discovered six additional crashes involving Teslas and first-responder vehicles where Autopilot was in use.  The expanded probe of Autopilot is the latest sign that U.S. auto-safety regulators are getting more aggressive in scrutinizing advanced vehicle technologies that automate some or all of the driving tasks.  NHTSA is getting ready to release new crash data this month that will give the public its first detailed look at the frequency and severity of incidents involving what are known as automated driving or advanced driver-assistance features, The Wall Street Journal has reported.  More than 100 companies are subject to an agency order requiring them to report crashes in which such systems were in use. Among those included are operators of autonomous-car fleets, like Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo and General Motors Co.'s Cruise LLC.  The technology under scrutiny includes lane-keeping assistance and cruise-control systems that keep a fixed distance behind a leading car, as well as higher-tech systems such as features that can guide a car along highways with minimal driver input.  Autopilot has become a particular focus for U.S. regulators in recent years, prompted by incidents in which drivers have misused the technology, overriding safety functions to operate a vehicle without their hands on the wheel, for example. Some critics also said the term Autopilot risks giving drivers an inflated sense of the system's capabilities.  NHTSA said in its latest filing that driver use or misuse of Autopilot doesn't necessarily preclude the agency from determining whether the technology is defective.  ""This is particularly the case if the driver behavior in question is foreseeable in light of the system's design or operation,"" NHTSA said. Auto makers are legally required to initiate a recall if a safety defect is discovered in their vehicles.  Separately, NHTSA has opened a broader investigation into several dozen crashes where advanced driver-assistance features are suspected to have played a role. While the probe covers vehicles made by any car company, incidents involving Teslas represent most of the cases.

"Document J000000020220604ei640001g",NA,"EXCHANGE --- Tesla Comes Under Scrutiny Over Braking","By Kathryn Hardison","338 words","4 June 2022","The Wall Street Journal","J",NA,"B10",NA,"English","Copyright 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.","The U.S. auto-safety regulator is asking Tesla Inc. to provide information over a growing number of customer complaints that the company's most popular vehicles brake for unexpected reasons as it intensifies its monthslong scrutiny of the issue.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Friday that it issued a letter to Tesla last month after receiving 758 reports of unexpected braking, often called ""phantom braking,"" in some Model 3 sedans and Model Y crossover vehicles from 2021 and 2022. The figure is about double the number of complaints NHTSA earlier this year said it had received. The auto maker has until June 20 to respond, NHTSA said.","Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment. The auto maker has said its cars have the highest safety rating attainable in the U.S.  The company's shares closed 9% lower Friday.  The braking occurs when the vehicle's advanced driver-assistance features, part of a system called Autopilot, are engaged, consumers have alleged.  In a letter to Eddie Gates, Tesla's director of field quality, NHTSA requested the company provide details related to the vehicles Tesla has manufactured, consumer complaints and its field reports.  NHTSA also requested Tesla provide copies of all documents, analyses, telematics reports, data logs and videos or photos for the Model Y and Model 3 vehicles, noting that it aims to determine the scope and severity of the potential problem. Such probes can lead to recalls.  If the company fails to respond, Tesla could be subject to civil penalties and other actions.  NHTSA has been scrutinizing Tesla's systems more closely in recent months.  The agency opened a broader investigation into Autopilot last year after a series of crashes involving Teslas and one or more parked emergency vehicles.  Tesla has already agreed to 12 recalls that could affect more than 2.25 million vehicles, according to NHTSA. Those recalls were issued for fixes to air bags, seats, electrical systems and backover prevention.

"Document J000000020211026ehaq0001n",NA,"Tesla Hits $1 Trillion Valuation Following Big Order --- Company joins tech titans in exclusive club after its stock more than doubles in a year","By Rebecca Elliott and Dave Sebastian","869 words","26 October 2021","The Wall Street Journal","J",NA,"A1",NA,"English","Copyright 2021 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.","Tesla Inc. crossed $1 trillion in market value Monday, joining a select group of companies after its stock price more than doubled this past year on surging vehicle sales and rising profits.  Investors pushed the electric-vehicle maker over the line after Hertz Global Holdings Inc. ordered 100,000 autos to be delivered to the rental-car company by the end of next year, a bulk purchase that promises to expose more mainstream drivers to Tesla's technology.","Apple Inc. Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc. are the only other U.S. companies worth more $1 trillion. Facebook Inc. was part of the group, but its share price has since retreated. Tesla, which last week reported record quarterly profit, is worth more than the next nine largest auto makers by market capitalization combined.  ""Wild $T1mes!"" Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted Monday afternoon. He added, of the Hertz order: ""Strange that moved valuation, as Tesla is very much a production ramp problem, not a demand problem.""  Tesla's stock closed at $1,024.86 a share, up more than 12% on the day and giving the company a market value of $1.03 trillion.  Tesla's valuation has soared unusually quickly. It took less than two years for Tesla's market value to grow from $100 billion to $1 trillion, according to Dow Jones Market Data. By contrast, it took Amazon more than eight years to cover that ground.  The run-up in Tesla's share price has benefited Mr. Musk, the company's largest shareholder and the world's wealthiest person. Mr. Musk's Tesla holdings, including vested and unvested options, were worth about $297 billion as of Monday, according to corporate-governance data company Equilar Inc. That is more than the valuation of Toyota Motor Corp., the second-largest auto maker by market capitalization.  Hertz's Tesla order is part of a broader effort by the rental company to give customers more battery-powered options on rental-car lots.  The Estero, Fla.-based company said that starting in early November and expanding through the end of the year, Hertz customers will be able to rent a Tesla Model 3 at airports and other locations in major U.S. markets and some cities in Europe.  Financial terms of the deal between Hertz and Tesla weren't provided. Based on list prices, the cost to Hertz would top $4 billion; however, historically it is common for such bulk orders to include a discount for the rental-car company. Mr. Musk on Monday tweeted that ""cars sold to Hertz have no discount.""  Electric vehicles will make up more than 20% of the company's global fleet with the current order, Hertz said Monday. The rental-car company said it introduced electric vehicles into its fleet in 2011.  The order represents a major chunk of Tesla's annual production volume, which has been growing in recent years. The electric-car maker delivered nearly half a million vehicles globally last year and, based on performance through September, is in a position to deliver nearly 900,000 vehicles to customers this year.  While the Hertz deal should allow more people to drive Teslas, it comes as scrutiny of Tesla's advanced driver-assistance features has intensified. On Monday, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board doubled down on earlier criticism, chastising Tesla for not addressing what the agency views as safety deficiencies in the company's driver-assistance technology.  ""[O]ur crash investigations involving your company's vehicles have clearly shown that the potential for misuse requires a system design change to ensure safety,"" NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said in a letter to Mr. Musk.  The NTSB investigates crashes and makes safety recommendations but doesn't have regulatory authority. The agency has urged Tesla to take additional steps to limit how drivers are able to use the company's advanced driver-assistance technology, which doesn't make vehicles autonomous.  Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment about the letter.  Hertz is making the investment after emerging from bankruptcy under new ownership. It filed for bankruptcy in May 2020 as the debt-laden company suffered from a collapse in reservations as travel came to a halt during the early days of the pandemic.  ""Electric vehicles are now mainstream, and we've only just begun to see rising global demand and interest,"" said Mark Fields, Hertz's interim chief executive.  Hertz warned that efforts to electrify its fleet could be hampered by factors outside its control, such as the shortage of semiconductors and other constraints. Tesla has a network of charging stations for its vehicles to augment those that people install in their homes. Tesla users, at times, have complained about long wait periods at charging facilities. Tesla says on its website that it has more than 25,000 charging stations world-wide, principally in North America and Europe. Hertz said it is also installing thousands of electric-vehicle chargers in its network.  ---  Ken Jimenez contributed to this article.

"Document J000000020211018ehai0000g",NA,"Inside View: Failure Is Always an Option","By Andy Kessler","829 words","18 October 2021","The Wall Street Journal","J",NA,"A15",NA,"English","Copyright 2021 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.","As the Elizabeth Holmes trial for alleged fraud at her startup Theranos winds on, the biggest question is: When the company's blood testing machines didn't work, why didn't she change tactics? Real entrepreneurs fail early and often. Ms. Holmes instead was stubborn and chose deception over failure. That's a shame. Despite today's IPO and SPAC fireworks, the truth is that in Silicon Valley most ideas fail. Heck, most companies fail. More than half of venture-capital investments are smoking holes in the ground. Fortunately, success often rises from the ashes of ruin.","Some history of failure: Thomas Edison, the ""Wizard of Menlo Park"" (New Jersey, not California), had the hardest time finding a filament for his incandescent lightbulb. He tried bamboo, cedar and flax until he found that carbonized cotton worked. ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work,"" Edison said. Fail until you succeed beats fake it till you make it.  Then there is the computer mouse. The Douglas Engelbart version of 1968 was a crude wooden block on two wheels with three buttons. Xerox PARC came up with a better mouse using a metal ball and motion sensors. Steve Jobs wanted one, so Apple hired a design firm, which came up with over 25 prototypes, all failures, until a design in 1981 worked. Think of all the failed mice it took to create today's curved mouse with multiple buttons, a scroll wheel and optical sensors. Speaking of failures, James Dyson made 5,127 prototypes over four years for his ""cyclone"" vacuum cleaner.  Entrepreneur Stewart Butterfield once tried to build a multiplayer online game but switched to photo sharing, selling Flickr to Yahoo in 2005 for $25 million. Success, but not a home run in Silicon Valley. Mr. Butterfield left Yahoo in 2008 to help found a company called Tiny Speck and build another multiplayer online game called ""Glitch."" Persistence! ""Glitch"" attracted tens of thousands of gamers, but not enough to cover its costs, so Mr. Butterfield killed it in 2012.  Tiny Speck pivoted, which in Silicon Valley means fail and scramble to do something else. The company had built its own crude internal communications system for employees to chat digitally during the development of ""Glitch."" Maybe others would use it. Seven months after they started work on Slack, the company announced its preview release. On the first day of the press blitz, 8,000 people requested the preview version. In February 2014 Slack had 16,000 users and by November it had 285,000, with 73,000 paying for it. Now more than 10 million people use it daily. Mr. Butterfield sold Slack to Salesforce for $27.7 billion last year. That's failing upward!  Then there's Elon Musk, who very openly noted, ""My proceeds from the PayPal acquisition were $180 million. I put $100 million in SpaceX, $70m in Tesla, and $10m in SolarCity. I had to borrow money for rent."" SpaceX was founded in 2002 and scraped by for years. Tesla's original Roadsters had quality issues, and I used to see flatbed trucks hauling failed Roadsters back to the dealership. SolarCity was kind of a dud.  Success has many fathers and detours. While we shouldn't encourage failure, we shouldn't penalize it either by shunning failed entrepreneurs as losers. Failure is part of the natural evolution to success.  Failure is why so many things are invented by entrepreneurs instead of by big companies. Few inside General Motors or General Electric or IBM want to risk their careers on something bold. Potential innovators fear failure that could tarnish their rise to department head and a slightly bigger office.  Venture capital and Silicon Valley are a virtuous risk-taking loop with money looking for returns and ideas looking for money. Rather than one command-and-control corporate person to pitch an idea to, there are scores of venture firms that specialize in hearing ""out there"" ideas. Get a no? Just walk across the street. Some VC firms even openly talk about the successful companies they chose not to fund.  Some big companies allow skunk-work projects, and Google even funds so-called moon shots like self-driving Waymo. But successful spinouts are still rare.  A friend once confessed to being nervous about joining a startup. ""What if it fails?"" he asked. After my usual suggestion of adding a zero to whatever share amount they offer, I said, ""So what? You're still you. You won't fail, though the company might. You can always get another job to make money or start something else."" Failure is an option, even if it isn't the preferred one. I wish someone had told that to Ms. Holmes.  ---  Write to kessler@wsj.com  (See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: Basic Due Diligence Turned Up Red Flags at Theranos"" -- WSJ Nov. 2, 2021)   CO 	 thrns : Theranos, Inc.

"Document J000000020211004eha40001z",NA,"Business News: Tesla Quarterly Deliveries Hit Record Despite Supply Snarls","By Rebecca Elliott","587 words","4 October 2021","The Wall Street Journal","J",NA,"B3",NA,"English","Copyright 2021 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.","Tesla Inc. overcame snarled global supply chains to deliver a record number of vehicles in the third quarter.  The Silicon Valley electric-vehicle maker delivered 241,300 vehicles to customers in the three months ended in September, it said Saturday, up from 139,593 vehicles during the same period last year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet forecast Tesla would deliver roughly 227,000 vehicles in the quarter.","The result positions Tesla to easily achieve its full-year goal of increasing deliveries by more than 50% over last year's total of nearly half a million vehicles. The company has put a total of roughly 627,000 vehicles in customer hands through the first nine months of the year.  That growth comes despite supply-chain disruptions that have constrained vehicle production across the global auto industry, leaving buyers with fewer options and denting sales. It has also upended the usual hierarchy in the U.S. auto market, where Toyota Motor Corp. outsold traditional standard-bearer General Motors Co. in the third quarter.  The continuing semiconductor shortage is likely to cost the global auto industry $210 billion in lost revenues this year, consulting firm AlixPartners LLP said. In the U.S., the pace of auto sales was expected to fall in September to an annualized rate of 12.4 million vehicles, the lowest rate since May 2020, according to Wards Intelligence.  Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk nodded to those headwinds in a note to employees last month, in which he said the company worked around shortages by building cars with missing parts that needed to be added later, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Tesla delivered a combined 232,025 Model 3 sedans and Model Y compact sport-utility vehicles in the third quarter, up from 124,318 of those models a year earlier. It was the first full quarter since Tesla introduced an upgraded version of its Model S luxury sedan, dubbed the Plaid.  The company handed over 9,275 of its higher-end models: Model S sedans and Model X sport-utility vehicles. Tesla delivered a total of 15,275 Model S and Model X vehicles during last year's third quarter.  As of Friday, analysts surveyed by FactSet expected Tesla to report third-quarter profits of around $1.1 billion on revenue of more than $13 billion. That is up from a $331 million profit on $8.8 billion in revenue during the year-prior period.  Tesla meanwhile has been preparing to expand public access to an advanced driver-assistance tool that is designed to help people navigate cities, adding to a suite of features that has mainly been intended for highway driving.  The promise of Tesla's advanced driver-assistance software has attracted customers and investors, helping to transform Tesla into the most valuable auto maker in the world. Its shares closed at $775.22 Friday.  ""[P]otential for further upside for the stock will be defined by Tesla's success in endeavors outside vehicle sales -- specifically on vehicle autonomy,"" Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy wrote in a recent note to investors.  Yet the company has drawn scrutiny from a chorus of transportation officials and safety advocates who have expressed concern about possible misuse of such tools. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation in August into advanced driver-assistance features offered by the company after a series of crashes involving Teslas and one or more parked emergency vehicles.

"Document J000000020210927eh9r0000l",NA,"Inside View: Ilhan Omar's Idea of Progress","By Andy Kessler","850 words","27 September 2021","The Wall Street Journal","J",NA,"A15",NA,"English","Copyright 2021 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.","Rep. Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.), along with five other Democrats, recently introduced H.R. 4894, the Genuine Progress Indicator Act of 2021. The bill, only six pages long, is a glaring example of why Congress has a meager 28% approval rating.  The goal is a progressive alternative to gross domestic product, which presumably is an unjust tool to prop up big bad business. ""The world needs new economic indicators and economic policies that will prioritize and encourage truly sustainable and equitable development,"" Ms. Omar claims. The bill requires that ""the head of each Federal agency, the President, the Chair of the Federal Reserve, and Congress shall"" use both the genuine progress indicator and GDP when budgeting or forecasting economic activity.","The new measure, a cousin of the United Nations' squishy World Happiness Report, is likely being proposed to rationalize the progressive multitrillion ""infrastructure"" spending blowout. The genuine progress indicator aims to blur the lines between entitlement and investment. This is dangerous. As Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D., N.Y.) tweeted, ""Paid leave is infrastructure. Child care is infrastructure. Caregiving is infrastructure."" No, they're not.  So what is genuine progress? A 2018 paper in Ecological Economics -- regrettably, my subscription has lapsed -- defines it as the net of benefits and costs neglected in GDP, things like ""inequality, regrettable defensive expenditures, uncounted environmental externalities, depletion of natural resources, and trade-offs with non-work uses of time."" Squishy indeed.  In H.R. 4894, benefits that don't show up in GDP but would in the genuine progress indicator include ""environmental and social factors"" addressing ""ecological scarcities"" and directing ""resources to sustainable development without degrading the environment,"" you know, things like carbon sequestration and ""maintenance of biological and genetic diversity."" Probably on purpose, these are not as easy to measure as lemonade sales or how many widgets roll off an assembly line. I would guess when Democrats are in control, genetic diversity and social factors would rise, and when Republicans are, environmental degradation would send genuine progress spiraling.  Home improvements, especially solar panels, would be a benefit, as would infrastructure like sewers and bridges. OK. And higher education. Got to fund those professors. But then it gets fuzzy. ""Time spent on leisure activities,"" ""household duties"" and ""volunteering"" are all benefits. So are ""hunting and fishing"" and ""harvesting of plants for medicinal and edible purposes."" So yes, playing ""Call of Duty: Black Ops"" is a sign of genuine progress. So is cleaning your garage. And growing rutabagas -- or weed -- in your garden. As is a lazy day fishing for trout. Do your part to juice genuine progress by vacationing all year!  But sadly, there are costs. Aren't there always? Income inequality is the first cost listed. It must be really bad for genuine progress. According to the World Bank, whose credibility shattered after it was caught juicing economic numbers for China, the U.S. ranks 51st in the world in inequality with a GINI coefficient of 41.5. A GINI coefficient of 0 is perfect equality and 100 is total inequality. If only we could be like countries with lower GINI numbers, like Haiti or Iran or Tunisia or Kazakhstan or the most equal country in the world, with a GINI of 25, Ukraine. On second thought, no thanks.  There are plenty of other costs to genuine progress: underemployment, homelessness, domestic abuse, pollution and ""the loss of natural wetlands."" Fair enough, these are legitimate and undermeasured economic concerns. But, wouldn't you know it, ""high amounts of carbon dioxide"" and ""depletion of nonrenewable sources of energy"" are also costs.  Then the bill adds this doozy as a cost: ""lost leisure time due to traffic congestion."" No one likes to be stuck in traffic, though it's often a productive time to make long phone calls and to think. Or, if you dare, you could put your Tesla on autopilot and watch Netflix in the back seat.  But here's the rub: The pandemic lockdowns would have caused an improvement in some factors of the genuine progress indicator. There was no traffic anywhere. As the economy tanked, we used less oil. The smog cleared in Los Angeles and coyotes joined the homeless on the streets of San Francisco. We don't need fantasyland economic indicators so politicians could argue for more lockdowns.  Yes, GDP is flawed. Official inflation numbers miss the technology-driven improvements in our lives. The billionfold drop in computing costs over the past 50 years barely shows up in GDP. There should be serious debate about how we should measure an economy, or if we even have to.  But Ms. Omar's bill is meant to change the subject, similar to stakeholder vs. shareholder capitalism. And it would become an excuse factory: ""Yes, our schools are failing, but the genuine progress indicator was up 0.3% last month."" Sadly, the time spent debating or even thinking about the bill, like being stuck in traffic, would lower the genuine progress indicator. Better if Congress goes fishing.  ---  Write to kessler@wsj.com   NS 	 gcat : Political/General News | gsust : Sustainable Development/Sustainability | ecat : Economic News | gpol : Domestic Politics | gvcng : Legislative Branch | nedc : Commentaries/Opinions | e11 : Economic Performance/Indicators | e1101 : Economic Growth/Recession | genv : Natural Environment | gpir : Politics/International Relations | gvbod : Government Bodies | ncat : Content Types | nfact : Factiva Filters | nfcpex : C&E Executive News Filter  RE 	 usa : United States | namz : North America  IPC 	 CNG | USG | NND | EDP  PUB 	 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.",NA

Jennifer Homendy, the new head of the National Transportation Safety Board, said Tesla shouldn't roll out the city-driving tool before addressing what the agency views as safety deficiencies in the company's technology. The NTSB, which investigates crashes and issues safety recommendations though it has no regulatory authority, has urged Tesla to clamp down on how drivers are able to use the company's driver-assistance tools.  ""Basic safety issues have to be addressed before they're then expanding it to other city streets and other areas,"" she said in an interview. Ms. Homendy also expressed concern about how Tesla software is tested on public roadways.  Ms. Homendy called Tesla's use of the term Full Self-Driving ""misleading and irresponsible,"" adding that people pay more attention to marketing than to warnings in car manuals or on a company's website. In Tesla's case, she said, ""It has clearly misled numerous people to misuse and abuse technology.""  Mr. Musk has said Tesla's advanced driver-assistance features prevent crashes and make driving safer. He has expressed mixed views about the Full Self-Driving system in recent months.  ""We need to make full self-driving work in order for it to be a compelling value proposition. Otherwise people are, you know, kind of betting on the future,"" he said in July, responding to a question about customer interest in subscribing to Tesla's Full Self-Driving package.  Tesla didn't respond to requests for comment.  Some safety advocates and transportation officials have raised concerns that drivers might be overestimating the capabilities of advanced driver-assistance systems such as Tesla's.  ""We're consistently hearing that it's definitely a work in progress, so it's just how do we make sure the public understands its limitations?"" Reema Griffith, executive director of the Washington State Transportation Commission, told The Wall Street Journal.  Tesla's urban-driving aid so far has only been available to a relatively small circle of employees and customers for testing purposes. The company began releasing a pilot version late last year, according to company correspondence with the California Department of Motor Vehicles, and has been expanding access. The program included about 2,000 Tesla owners as of March, Mr. Musk said.  Tesla plans to monitor the driving patterns of the customers who request the enhanced system, Mr. Musk said last week in a tweet, and grant access after seven days of good behavior. Those who aren't careful will have their access revoked, he said.  ""2000 beta users operating for almost a year with no accidents. Needs to stay that way,"" Mr. Musk said.  The company began deploying advanced driver-assistance software, dubbed Autopilot, to vehicles in 2015 to help with tasks such as steering and adjusting to the flow of traffic on the highway. It has augmented that system over the years, with the goal of eventually enabling its vehicles to operate autonomously.  Tesla's new city-driving tool is part of its Full Self-Driving package. Tesla sells the suite for $10,000 or a monthly subscription that costs up to $199. Other features in the Full Self-Driving bundle are already publicly available, including tools that help vehicles change lanes on the highway and slow down at stop signs. New Street Research estimated in July that about 360,000 people had purchased the Full Self-Driving system, covering about one-fifth of the Tesla fleet at the time.  Investors' belief in the promise of Tesla's automation technology has helped to transform the company into the world's most valuable auto maker, with a market capitalization of around $750 billion, more than five times that of Volkswagen AG. Last year, Volkswagen delivered more than 18 times as many vehicles as Tesla.  Tesla's technology has faced increasing scrutiny. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the country's auto-safety regulator, launched a probe last month after a spate of crashes in which Teslas that had been operating with Autopilot engaged ran into one or more parked emergency vehicles such as police cars. NHTSA has requested a trove of data from Tesla and other auto makers as it seeks to compare advanced driver-assistance systems. The agency also recently began requiring auto makers to report serious crashes involving such features.  Meanwhile, the California DMV is reviewing whether Tesla violated a state regulation that bars companies from falsely advertising vehicles as autonomous.  Ms. Homendy said those with regulatory power should be moving more aggressively to issue appropriate regulations. ""Doing investigations after the fact, that's a tombstone mentality,"" she said. ""You can proactively address potential future crashes and future deaths by taking action, by issuing regulations, performance standards aimed at saving lives.""  A NHTSA spokeswoman said the agency was taking steps that were necessary precursors to any new regulatory action.  Ken McElhaney Jr., a 61-year-old retired insurance agent from Mobile, Ala., bought Tesla's upgraded driver-assistance system last year. He said he knew the system was a ""work in progress"" when he bought it -- and that was part of the appeal.  ""It's a little bit like going to a restaurant on a soft opening,"" he said. ""It's kind of fun to be in early, but you understand they're still working out the kinks.""   CO 	 ntsbd : National Transportation Safety Board | teslmi : Tesla, Inc.

"Document J000000020210901eh910000h",NA,"Tesla and the Metaverse","By Holman W. Jenkins, Jr.","859 words","1 September 2021","The Wall Street Journal","J",NA,"A13",NA,"English","Copyright 2021 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.","Tesla chief Elon Musk was obliged to make an ignominious admission to the California Department of Motor Vehicles. What Tesla dubs its ""Full Self Driving Capability,"" and charges up to $10,000 for, is actually, in the jargon of the industry, a Level 2 driving aid. In other words, no different from what other car makers, from GM to Kia, provide as an option or even standard equipment. It can steer and match traffic speed on the highway or in bumper-to-bumper situations. In no case, though, are you encouraged to take your hands off the wheel and eyes off the road.","Tesla's Level 2 package also appears to fail disconcertingly at a basic autonomous vehicle job, performed in many cars by a radar array costing less than $200. It doesn't reliably avoid collisions with stationary objects such as emergency vehicles. A federal investigation has opened and we can already anticipate its findings: Tesla's implementation of Level 2 is as good as anybody's; the problem is caused by Tesla owners believing their cars to be more advanced than they are.  By now a succession of Mr. Musk's claims have painted a trajectory to a universe still out of view. By last year, Tesla should have flipped a switch and turned every Tesla into a free-roaming robot taxi, earning its owner easy money when the car otherwise would be idle.  OK, it's been three years since the media began backpedaling from its own role in self-driving hype. Uber and Lyft have sold off their autonomous vehicle experiments.  But while self-driving is stuck in neutral, the technology underlying it has advanced by leaps: artificial intelligence, machine vision, graphical computation, mobile bandwidth.  The problem for autonomous driving is the real-world complications: a heavy object collides with another heavy object, causing injury, death, property damage and lawsuits. But the same technology is increasingly capable of creating digital representations of the real world in which these untoward outcomes never arise.  These artificial worlds, ironically, are already at work trying to fix the challenges of autonomous driving. In simulated environments, software is being trained on unlikely scenarios involving, say, a combination of bicyclists, defaced stop signs and windblown plastic bags that even teams of thousands of networked cars might not encounter in years of driving.  But then a question comes up: Who needs a self-driving car when you can have a self-driving car simulator?  Think about it.  You might still jump into a car to avoid a Zoom meeting in favor of a real-world encounter with colleagues or friends. But how about the option demonstrated by Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, in which participants, using Oculus headsets, could feel uncannily present as a group of avatars, even hearing their voices from different directions? The avatars are Wii-like now but one day may be indistinguishable from real persons.  Facebook is not everybody's bet to win the race for the ""metaverse,"" to use the word suddenly on the lips of every computing and telecommunications executive.  Nvidia, the graphics chip maker, recently launched an artificial environment suite called Omniverse, which tellingly includes Pixar's (the animation movie studio) ""Universal Scene Description"" software. ""The economy in the metaverse will be larger than the economy in the physical world,"" predicts Nvidia chief Jensen Huang.  In another self-driving irony, BMW has adopted Omniverse to maintain an exacting simulation of its plant in Regensburg, Germany. BMW uses the artificial environment to experiment with new ways of building cars that fewer people in the future might need if it turns out they prefer to inhabit artificial environments.  It will be easier and more fun to go places artificially. In the metaverse, you can arrive instantly, or if you want the experience of traveling, arrive at any speed. If you feel like having an accident on the way, you can. If you want to experience a head-on collision with a tractor-trailer, feel free, just for fun. If you want to drive through New York City at 200 mph, you can. Cher can be waving at you from every corner. A parade of brontosauruses can be waiting to cross at the next light.  Human beings already interact by the thousands in videogame worlds they prefer to the real world. In another self-driving irony, Elon Musk has been artificial reality's greatest salesman, with his frequent musing that we already exist in a simulation.  Yes, the self-driving car is coming. In fact, it's here. Waymo (the Google affiliate) operates on the meticulously mapped, weather-free streets of Phoenix. Self-driving vehicles will soon be turning up in other controlled settings. Stretches of highway may one day be engineered to let drivers turn their attention to their iPads for extended periods.  But the day may never come when a self-driving car will be able to take you most places a real driver can, in every kind of weather. And, by then, so much of our lives may be in the cloud that it won't matter.   CO 	 cadmvh : California Department of Motor Vehicles | teslmi : Tesla, Inc.

"Document J000000020210817eh8h0001x",NA,"Tesla's Ascent Can't Remain on Autopilot","By Charley Grant","409 words","17 August 2021","The Wall Street Journal","J",NA,"B12",NA,"English","Copyright 2021 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.","[Financial Analysis and Commentary]  Monday's news that U.S. auto safety regulators are investigating Tesla's advanced driver-assistance system Autopilot after a series of crashes involving emergency vehicles didn't seriously rattle its shareholders.","The auto maker's shares fell by 4.3% on Monday but have doubled over the past year. There are bigger, more mundane risks to Tesla's stock price, though.  In some ways, investors' nonchalant attitude makes sense given the company's history. Chief Executive Elon Musk has clashed with various regulators over the past half decade. Even serious incidents, such as Mr. Musk's 2018 settlement of securities fraud charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission, have only briefly affected Tesla's fortunes on Wall Street. As for Autopilot, regulators have looked into various incidents with the system since 2016 and haven't taken action against Tesla that would cost investors.  Being able to overlook those bumps in the road has proved profitable, resulting in huge gains for long-term shareholders but also creating a problem for the stock in the present. Tesla is sporting an extraterrestrial valuation in an earthbound industry: Its market value stands at more than five times the combined value of Ford Motor and General Motors, despite having minuscule global market share.  That valuation is even more concerning when one considers that Tesla has lately posted its best business results on record: The auto maker earned $1.41 a share in the first half of this year. Assuming things continue to go well, Tesla might earn $4 a share in 2021. Even under that scenario, Tesla trades at about 170 times this year's earnings. The mightiest auto manufacturers command perhaps 12 times earnings in a typical environment.  Meanwhile, incumbent auto makers have embraced electric cars after decades of indifference, which isreason to worry that growth prospects for Tesla aren't as rosy as Wall Street seems to think. Indeed, customers in Western Europe, a highly friendly market for electric cars, registered roughly 98,000 Teslas in 2020, down about 11% from 2019, while overall registrations of all-electric vehicles more than doubled, according to Schmidt Automotive Research. Tesla's share of the market fell to around 13% in 2020 from about 31% a year earlier.  That should give sensible investors reason to pump the brakes, even if Monday's selloff quickly loses its charge.   RF 	 page,5043  CO 	 teslmi : Tesla, Inc.

"Document J000000020210817eh8h0001n",NA,"Tesla's Autopilot Faces Federal Safety Inquiry","By Rebecca Elliott","959 words","17 August 2021","The Wall Street Journal","J",NA,"A1",NA,"English","Copyright 2021 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.","U.S. auto safety regulators are investigating Tesla Inc.'s advanced driver-assistance system known as Autopilot after a series of crashes at emergency scenes.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration probe made public Monday is the latest sign that U.S. authorities are beginning to scrutinize driver-assistance technologies more closely after largely giving companies free rein.","NHTSA said it had identified 11 crashes since early 2018 in which a Tesla vehicle that had been using Autopilot struck one or more vehicles involved in an emergency-response situation.  Four of the crashes NHTSA is probing happened this year and most took place after dark, the agency said. In one such crash in March, the driver of a Tesla Model Y had Autopilot engaged before plowing into a police vehicle that had stopped along a Lansing, Mich., area highway to investigate a separate crash, Michigan State Police said. The police vehicle had its emergency lights on, police said.  NHTSA is studying the Autopilot system in some 765,000 Tesla vehicles from the 2014 through 2021 model years. Autopilot is available on vehicles made in late 2014 and later, according to Tesla's website. Such investigations can but don't always lead to recalls.  Advanced driver-assistance systems aren't tightly regulated in the U.S. NHTSA recently began requiring companies to regularly report crashes involving such features to the agency.  Tesla, whose shares were down more than 4% Monday, didn't respond to a request to comment. The electric-vehicle company has long said that driving with Autopilot engaged is safer than doing so without it.  Autopilot is designed to help drivers with tasks such as steering and keeping a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. Tesla instructs drivers using the system to pay attention to the road and to keep their hands on the wheel.  However, the system has drawn scrutiny for how some drivers misuse the technology, overriding safety functions to operate the vehicle without their hands on the wheel, for example. Some critics also said the term Autopilot risks giving drivers an inflated sense of the system's capabilities.  NHTSA said its probe would examine how the car maker monitors driver engagement and how vehicles identify roadway obstacles. The agency has opened more than two dozen investigations into crashes thought to be related to Tesla's advanced driver-assistance system.  Sean Kane, president of auto safety advocacy organization Safety Research & Strategies Inc., welcomed NHTSA's Autopilot probe but said that the agency should have set stricter rules to begin with.  ""It's an after-the-fact fix when it could have been dealt with on the front end and prevented,"" he said.  Tesla uses examples of traffic scenarios to train its driver-assistance technology and help determine the appropriate course of action.  Autopilot has evolved over time and has long relied on a combination of cameras, radar and other sensors. However, several months ago, the company did away with radar in Model 3 sedans and Model Y compact sport-utility vehicles made for the North American market.  Duke University engineering professor Mary ""Missy"" Cummings said that cameras and radar can both have trouble recognizing parked police cruisers or other equipment such as traffic cones. Radar can struggle to distinguish between stationary objects, while cameras will help a vehicle identify obstacles only if the system has been trained to recognize that specific scenario, she said.  Emergency vehicles don't always behave in consistent ways -- sometimes pulling over and partially blocking a lane -- and that can make it challenging for driver-assistance systems to react appropriately.  ""This is why emergency situations are so problematic,"" Dr. Cummings said. ""The visual presentation is never the same.""  Andrej Karpathy, senior director of artificial intelligence at Tesla, recently spoke about some of those challenges while discussing the company's technology at an industry conference. ""The problem with radar is like, once in a while, at random, it will give you a dumb measurement, and you will not know when that is,"" he said in June.  NHTSA's action adds to the heightened regulatory scrutiny Tesla has faced in recent months.  Earlier this year, two U.S. senators -- Democrats Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Edward Markey of Massachusetts -- urged NHTSA to develop recommendations for improving advanced driver-assistance systems such as Tesla's Autopilot. Their comments followed a fatal crash in Texas, though another federal safety agency that investigates crashes, the National Transportation Safety Board, has since raised doubts that Autopilot was involved.  Sens. Blumenthal and Markey called on NHTSA to conduct its investigation quickly, thoroughly and in a transparent manner.  The probe ""should inform the agency's recommendations on fixes the company must implement to improve the safety of its automated driving and driver assistance technology and prevent future crashes,"" the senators said in a joint statement Monday.  Tesla recently recalled more than 285,000 vehicles in China to address a cruise control-related safety issue.  China's State Administration for Market Regulation said Tesla's cruise-control system could be activated accidentally, potentially causing sudden acceleration. Most of the vehicles affected by the recall were made at Tesla's factory in Shanghai, and the software fix could be completed remotely. Tesla apologized to car owners in connection with the recall and said it would continue to improve safety in line with national requirements.  In the U.S., Tesla agreed early this year to recall about 135,000 Model S and Model X vehicles over touch-screen failures. Tesla said at the time that it disagreed that the issue constituted a defect in the vehicles but that it was going ahead with a recall in the interest of customer experience.

"Document J000000020210630eh6u0001q",NA,"U.S. News: Driver-Assistance Crashes Get Scrutiny","By Matt Grossman","370 words","30 June 2021","The Wall Street Journal","J",NA,"A3",NA,"English","Copyright 2021 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.","Federal regulators are tightening their oversight of car crashes that involve advanced driver-assistance or automated-driving features, a shift that follows growing concern over the role that systems such as Tesla Inc.'s Autopilot have had in crashes.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a new order on Tuesday that companies must report serious crashes involving driver-assistance and automated-driving systems to authorities within a day of learning about them. Manufacturers and operators will also have to issue broader monthly reports about their vehicles' safety.","""Gathering data will help instill public confidence that the federal government is closely overseeing the safety of automated vehicles,"" NHTSA acting Administrator Steven Cliff said.  The data will help investigators track patterns in automated-driving crashes, the agency said.  The order applies to simpler driver-assistance features that are already relatively commonplace, as well as more automated systems that are just beginning to gain wider adoption. The technology under scrutiny includes lane-keeping assistance and cruise-control systems that keep a fixed distance behind a leading car, as well as higher-tech systems such as features offered by Tesla that can guide a car along highways with minimal driver input.  Tesla didn't respond to an inquiry.  Potential safety issues with the systems include sensor failures and faulty decisions by software algorithms, NHTSA said in the order.  Fully self-driving cars, such as those being developed by Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo, would also fall under the order's purview, the administration said. Waymo operates a ride-hailing service in the Phoenix area using autonomous minivans, and other developers have been testing self-driving cars on public roads in various cities.  NHTSA, which regulates auto makers, has looked into more than two dozen accidents involving Tesla vehicles, including several this year. One, a fatal Texas crash in April, happened without Autopilot engaged, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Twitter.  That accident followed three other nonfatal Tesla crashes in February and March that also drew federal probes.  The National Transportation Safety Board, which issues safety recommendations, has also encouraged NHTSA to do more to ensure that driver-assistance features are safe.

"Document J000000020210522eh5m0001v",NA,"REVIEW --- Books: They Think They're So Smart","By David A. Shaywitz","1766 words","22 May 2021","The Wall Street Journal","J",NA,"C7",NA,"English","Copyright 2021 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.","'I, for one, welcome our new computer overlords,"" a wry Ken Jennings wrote in 2011 after he was decisively defeated in ""Jeopardy!"" by IBM's Watson computer and the artificial intelligence that powered it. A decade later, Mr. Jennings's sentiments seem prescient. Alexa and Siri inhabit our homes and our devices. Digital transformation has overtaken our workplaces. AI-driven recommendation engines help determine the movies we watch, the products we buy and the information we receive, influencing our preferences and inflaming our politics.  Yet the concept of intelligent computers, advanced by the British mathematician Alan Turing in 1950, isn't new; nor is the term ""artificial intelligence,"" first used at a research conference in 1956. What has changed is AI's power and reach, especially with the arrival of what is called ""deep learning"" -- the capacity for powerful pattern recognition, with seemingly little human instruction required.","In ""Genius Makers"" (Dutton, 370 pages, $28), New York Times technology reporter Cade Metz tells the story of the scientists who developed deep learning, a small group of researchers ""who nurtured an idea for decades, often in the face of unfettered skepticism before it suddenly came of age.""  At the epicenter of the effort is Geoff Hinton, scion of a long line of prominent British academics. Captivated by the idea that computers could mimic the brain, Mr. Hinton followed his passion from Edinburgh to Pittsburgh to the University of Toronto, where he and his students, in the early 2010s, showed that a mathematical system ""modeled on the web of neurons in the brain"" could identify common objects ""with an accuracy that had previously seemed impossible."" The feat was achievable so long as the computer could first learn from vast troves of data. The approach rapidly moved from the detection of cats in YouTube videos to intuitive digital assistants and software designed to flag credit-card fraud.  Mr. Hinton and his students were soon working for Google, while colleagues were snatched up by other tech powerhouses like Facebook in California and Baidu in China, companies ""caught up in the same global arms race"" for AI technology and expertise. So intense was the drive for talent that one Microsoft executive compared the cost of acquiring an AI researcher to the cost of acquiring an NFL quarterback.  While some researchers, such as Mr. Hinton's former student Alex Krizhevsky, described their work in measured terms, most were expansive. Mr. Metz notes that there is a long tradition of AI researchers and tech leaders promising ""lifelike technology that was nowhere close to actually working."" Former Google chairman Eric Schmidt stands out for his ""haughty,"" ""patronizing"" manner and habit of addressing audiences ""as if he knew more than anyone else in the room, about both the past and the future.""  This trait of living as if the future had already arrived, observes Mr. Metz, seems especially common among the Silicon Valley elite, who recognize that ""ideas might fail. Predictions might not be met. But the next idea wouldn't succeed unless they, and everybody around them, believed that it could."" To sell the future effectively, Mr. Metz's evangelists seem to suggest, you need first to inhabit it yourself.  Such hyperbole irks British AI researcher Michael Wooldridge, who aims, in ""A Brief History of Artificial Intelligence"" (Flatiron, 262 pages, $27.99), to provide a level-headed introduction to the evolution of the science. He dismisses what he calls the grand dream of AI -- ""a computer that has the full range of intellectual capabilities that a person has"" -- as ""nothing more than speculation."" He prefers to focus on what AI really tries to do: getting computers to perform specific tasks. We're guided through AI's tumultuous history as it careers wildly between periods of great hope and years of intellectual despair known as ""AI winters.""  The recent progress in deep learning opened up all sorts of possibilities and applications, Mr. Wooldridge says. ""Everyone with data and a problem to solve started to ask whether deep learning might help them -- and in many cases, the answers proved to be 'yes.'"" But overestimating the power of this technology, he reminds us, can be dangerous. He cites Tesla's curiously named Autopilot -- a technology that allows AI to drive a car under human supervision. It has created a ""mismatch between driver expectations and the reality of what the system can do,"" potentially endangering operators who place excessive faith in the still-evolving software.  For computer scientist and entrepreneur Erik Larson, the fundamental error we make when thinking about AI is failing to recognize that ""human and machine intelligence are radically different."" He notes that success at achieving narrow computer applications -- say, playing chess -- gets us ""not one step closer to general intelligence."" The sort of intelligence we display every day, he reminds us in ""The Myth of Artificial Intelligence"" (Belknap/Harvard, 312 pages, $29.95), is not ""an algorithm running in our heads."" Rather our minds call on ""the entire cultural, historical, and social context within which we think and act in the world."" It's critical, Mr. Larson argues, not to replace complex discussions ""about individuals and societies"" with tidy technological narratives and one-dimensional abstractions.  More broadly, Mr. Larson worries that we're making two mistakes at once, defining human intelligence down while overestimating what AI is likely to achieve. IBM's Watson computer is a case in point. We trumpet the AI it uses while overlooking the role of the engineering team's ""careful and insightful game analysis."" In the case of the ""Jeopardy!"" contest, part of the team's analysis led to an ""exploitable shortcut"": 95% of the answers to the show's questions are Wikipedia titles, dramatically constraining the universe of possible responses through which Watson had to sort.  By reinterpreting human intelligence to fit a computational definition, we risk abandoning a ""richer understanding of the mind,"" Mr. Larson says. He invokes tech writer Jaron Lanier's lament that ""a new generation has come of age with a reduced expectation of what a person can be, and of who each person might become."" Another concern is learned passivity: our tendency to assume that AI will solve problems and our failure, as a result, to cultivate human ingenuity. ""Computers don't have insights,"" Mr. Larson reminds us. ""People do.""  Kate Crawford, a communications researcher, is also worried about the role of AI systems. She sees them as ""expressions of power that emerge from wider economic and political forces, created to increase profits and centralize control."" Convinced that these forces have promulgated a false narrative, she seeks, in ""Atlas of AI"" (Yale, 327 pages, $28), to adjust the story.  Ms. Crawford argues passionately that while AI is presented as disembodied, objective and inevitable, it is material, biased and subject to our own outlooks and ideologies. The ecosystem of AI, she says, ""relies on many kinds of extraction: from harvesting the data made from our daily activities and expressions, to depleting natural resources, and to exploiting labor around the globe."" She describes ""ghost work"" -- the labor of anonymous, low-paid employees who do the repetitive tasks that ""backstop claims of AI magic,"" such as labeling the images that are used to teach algorithms to recognize and distinguish objects.  The data sets by which artificial intelligence is ""trained,"" Ms. Crawford says, are shot through with bias and error. One commonly used criminal database, she notes, included the names of 42 infants -- including 28 who allegedly admitted to ""being gang members."" More broadly, she laments the ""collect-it-all mentality"" -- the idea that ""everything is data and is there for the taking."" We measure what we can, she notes, not necessarily what we should. She counsels us to focus less on tech founders and investors and more on the ""lived experiences of those who are disempowered, discriminated against, and harmed by AI systems.""  in ""Futureproof"" (Random House, 217 pages, $27), New York Times technology writer Kevin Roose is focused on what individuals -- ""people like you and me, with jobs and families and communities to worry about"" -- can do about the ascent of AI and the threat of automation. While sharing many of Ms. Crawford's concerns, he also envisions AI as a force for good, helping to remediate poverty, reverse climate change and reduce the burden of disease.  The threat of AI to our jobs, Mr. Roose perceptively observes, isn't that we'll show up to work one day like TV's George Jetson and find Uniblab the robot sitting at our desk. The danger is more nuanced -- desirable innovations may cause slow-motion shifts in staffing. An airline's deployment of AI to improve aircraft maintenance might help the planes last longer, reducing demand for replacement jets -- and for the workers who would otherwise manufacture them. Similarly, software to improve the loading of trucks could reduce the number of trucks needed for the same amount of freight and thus trim the number of drivers. ""We may want to stop worrying about killer droids and kamikaze drones,"" he writes, ""and start worrying about the mundane, mediocre apps and services that allow companies to process payroll 20% more efficiently, or determine benefits eligibility with fewer human caseworkers."" Another concern is AI at the level of middle management -- algorithms that methodically supervise tasks, monitor quality and evaluate performance, obviating the role (and expense) of human judgment.  We should lean into our humanity, Mr. Roose says, ""leaving our own, distinctly human mark on the things we're creating."" Job security, he suggests, depends less on what we do and more on how we do it.  Consider the example of the electronics retailer Best Buy, a company that a decade ago seemed to be circling the drain, unable to compete with Amazon on price. In 2012, Mr. Roose writes, the company hired a new CEO, Hubert Joly, who came up with a new strategy: compete on service. Best Buy started to focus on providing ""deeply human experiences that e-commerce retailers . . . couldn't match."" A home-adviser program, launched in 2017, was ""an immediate hit."" Today the stock is trading near an all-time high. The key insight, Mr. Joly told the author, was to recognize that the ""business we're in is not simply selling products -- it's connecting human needs with technology solutions. So, our focus is on these human needs."" He may be onto something.  ---  Dr. Shaywitz, a physician-scientist, is a digital health and connected fitness adviser and a lecturer at Harvard Medical School.

"Document J000000020210521eh5l0001n",NA,"Tesla Owners Trick Their Vehicles Into Self-Driving","By Katherine Bindley and Rebecca Elliott","935 words","21 May 2021","The Wall Street Journal","J",NA,"A1",NA,"English","Copyright 2021 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.","Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk for years has championed his vehicles' driver-assistance system called Autopilot, forecasting that self-driving cars are an emerging reality. Some would-be social-media stars and Tesla owners can't seem to wait.  Param Sharma, 25 years old, posted several videos to Instagram in which he appears to operate a Tesla while in the back seat with nobody at the wheel. Police in California arrested Mr. Sharma on May 10 for alleged reckless driving after an officer said he saw him operating a Tesla Model 3 from the back seat on a Bay Area highway.","Similar videos abound on social media, even though Tesla's technology is intended only as a way to assist drivers, who are instructed to keep their hands on the wheel. Echoing Mr. Musk's penchant for pushing the envelope, some Tesla drivers over the years created an online-video genre out of testing what is possible with their vehicles, in some cases appearing to override safety functions to perform stunts they post to YouTube or TikTok.  One TikTok user shared a video last year that appeared to depict a Tesla going more than 60 miles an hour on a highway with no one in the driver's seat while its passengers drank hard seltzer and sang along to Justin Bieber. The video, which refers to the car as the designated driver, has 1.7 million likes. The video's poster didn't respond to requests for comment.  Tesla's Autopilot has features designed to make hands-on driving easier and safer by helping with tasks such as steering and maintaining appropriate distance from others on the road. The company tells drivers repeatedly in its user manuals to remain engaged.  Tesla's public messaging has at times appeared inconsistent with those instructions. A 2019 video the company posted to YouTube shows a Tesla operating for well over a minute with the driver's hands not on the wheel. Mr. Musk drove a Tesla hands-free in a 2018 ""60 Minutes"" interview.  ""I'm highly confident the car will be able to drive itself with a reliability in excess of humans this year,"" he said in January.  Mr. Sharma, the Tesla driver recently arrested, said he was inspired by Mr. Musk. He said he regularly operates his vehicle from the back seat, occasionally touching the steering wheel with his foot to keep the vehicle from coming to a stop. A representative for the local district attorney said this week no decision had been made on whether to formally charge Mr. Sharma.  ""If Elon Musk is right about self-driving cars, then what I'm doing, like by next year, it'll be normal,"" said Mr. Sharma, adding that he doesn't view the behavior as risky because of his perception of the vehicle's capabilities.  Tesla and Mr. Musk didn't respond to requests for comment. Tesla has repeatedly said the features it offers make driving safer. Last month, Mr. Musk tweeted ""Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle.""  The National Transportation Safety Board and safety advocates have said Tesla isn't doing enough to prevent misuse. The California Department of Motor Vehicles said Monday it was reviewing whether Tesla violated a state regulation that bars companies from falsely advertising vehicles as autonomous.  Tesla vehicles are designed to monitor force applied to the steering wheel to ensure driver engagement, but people have found ways to trick aspects of the system. Last month, Consumer Reports rigged a Tesla Model Y to operate on Autopilot while no one was in the driver's seat by attaching a weighted chain to the wheel. (The person slid into the passenger's seat without opening a door, which would have shut off the assistance system.)  Christopher Allessi, a YouTuber, said he has made around 2,000 videos ""testing and pushing the limits of Tesla vehicles."" In one video, Mr. Alessi reviewed a so-called defeat device that can cost $180 and is intended to trick the system into believing the driver's hands are on the wheel. He calls reminders to clutch the wheel a ""pain in the butt"" and said the car's alerts can come on when the driver's hands rest on the wheel too lightly. In the video, he shows how to use the device to stop that from happening. He does urge drivers to maintain their hands on the wheel. ""If you're someone that's going to abuse it and read a book or go through your daily emails, no, you need to get your license taken away,"" he said.  Other YouTubers show viewers how to get around the alerts. They post videos demonstrating tricks like wedging an orange in the steering wheel or attaching a weight so the system thinks someone is touching the wheel.  Tyron Louw, a senior research fellow at the University of Leeds who studies how humans interact with automated driving systems, said people have a hard time understanding the limits of advanced driver-assistance features. Some of the videos of seeming misuse, he said, could lead to copycat behavior with unintended consequences. ""People are impressionable,"" Dr. Louw said. While owners bear responsibility for their choices, it is on Tesla to prevent misuse in the first place, he said.  ""If they know that their system is prone to hacks, then like with software engineering, they need to figure out when hacks are invading their system,"" Dr. Louw said.   CO 	 teslmi : Tesla, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.","Police in California arrested the driver of a Tesla for allegedly operating the vehicle from the backseat.  The California Highway Patrol on Tuesday said it had arrested 25-year-old Param Sharma for reckless driving of a Tesla Inc. Model 3 on Interstate 80 in the Bay Area.Mr. Sharma couldn't be reached for comment.","Police said they had received 911 calls about the driver. The officer in the arrest that took place Monday saw the driver, the lone occupant of the car, seated in the backseat, police said. Mr. Sharma moved to the driver's seat and stopped the car on the shoulder of the interstate, where he was arrested, the police said.  Mr. Sharma was charged with two counts of reckless driving and disobeying an officer. He also was cited with using his vehicle in a reckless manner in April, the police said.  The incident is the latest to raise questions about how some Tesla drivers use their vehicles, including the advanced driver-assistance features the company offers.  Tesla has said the driver-assistance system it calls Autopilot makes operating its vehicles safer. The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  The National Transportation Safety Board, which has the power to issue safety recommendations, has previously expressed concerns that there aren't clear rules in the U.S. about how companies should ensure drivers pay attention when driver-assistance features are engaged.  Tesla has said drivers using Autopilot must remain attentive with their hands on the wheel and that it has safety features to remind them to stay engaged.  A fatal crash last month in Texas drew widespread attention after local authorities said they found one occupant in the back seat and the other in the front passenger's seat, raising questions about whether or how the vehicle could have been operating without anyone in the driver's seat. The NTSB this week raised doubts the Autopilot system was involved, echoing earlier statements from Tesla.   CO 	 teslmi : Tesla, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.","Federal safety officials have raised doubts that a fatal April crash of a Tesla Inc. car involved the vehicle's advanced driver-assistance system.  The National Transportation Safety Board issued a preliminary report Monday that laid out some of the early evidence it has gathered, while stopping short of drawing conclusions about what caused the crash.","Tests at the crash site north of Houston using a representative vehicle showed that one of the features that would have been needed to use Tesla's driver-assistance system, known as Autopilot, wasn't available in that area, the agency said.  Local officials in Texas had said that one of the two men riding in the car was found in the front passenger's seat and the other in the back seat.  The local constable's office said, based on its early investigation, that it was highly likely the vehicle didn't have anyone in the driver's seat at the time of the crash, spurring questions about how that may have unfolded. The early assessment left questions about whether or how the vehicle could have been operating without anyone in the driver's seat. Both men died in the crash.  The NTSB said the vehicle owner's home-security system showed the owner entering the driver's seat of the Model S sedan and the other person entering the front passenger's seat.  The NTSB report didn't address when the owner eventually found dead in the back seat moved within the vehicle.  The vehicle traveled about 550 feet before driving over a curb, hitting a drainage culvert, a raised manhole and, eventually, a tree, damaging the front of the vehicle's lithium-ion battery case, the NTSB said.  The agency said that the resulting fire destroyed the vehicle and damaged a module that can record data tied to information such as vehicle speed, air-bag deployment and whether seat belts were buckled. The NTSB said it had taken the device to a lab for further analysis.  Another onboard storage device that could yield clues about what happened was destroyed by the fire, the NTSB said.  The initial report echoes statements from Tesla last month about the crash. A Tesla executive said during an earnings call that the company had conducted a study along with authorities in which it tried to replicate the likely crash scenario. The company said that a driver-assistance feature that helps with steering didn't engage in the test, while another feature, adaptive cruise control, only activated when a driver was buckled in and traveling at above 5 miles per hour.  The executive also said the car's steering wheel was found to be deformed, ""leading to the likelihood that someone was in the driver's seat at the time of the crash."" He didn't provide details about how the company came to that conclusion. All the seat belts, post crash, were found to be unbuckled, he said.  Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the NTSB's preliminary report. Soon after the crash, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted, ""Data logs recovered so far show Autopilot was not enabled.""  The NTSB said it was continuing to collect data on the crash, including the dynamics of the incident and the postmortem toxicology test results.  ""All aspects of the crash remain under investigation,"" it said, adding it planned to issue a final report with safety recommendations to prevent similar crashes.  The NTSB has said its probe also would examine the vehicle fire that took hours to completely extinguish.   CO 	 ntsbd : National Transportation Safety Board | teslmi : Tesla, Inc.

"Document J000000020210423eh4n00012",NA,"U.S. News: Senators Urge Tesla Scrutiny","By Rebecca Elliott","672 words","23 April 2021","The Wall Street Journal","J",NA,"A6",NA,"English","Copyright 2021 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.","Two U.S. senators have expressed concern about what they said may be an emerging pattern of safety concerns involving Tesla Inc. vehicles in the wake of a fatal crash in Texas.  In a letter Thursday to America's top automotive-safety regulator, Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts urged the agency to develop recommendations for improving advanced driver-assistance systems such as Tesla's Autopilot.","The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has opened a probe into the weekend crash, one of more than two dozen investigations into Tesla-involved crashes. The agency has said that most of those investigations are related to the vehicles' advanced driver-assistance features.  ""We fear safety concerns involving these vehicles are becoming a pattern, which is incredibly worrisome and deserves your undivided attention,"" the Democratic senators wrote about Tesla in the letter.  A Saturday crash involving a Tesla Model S has increased scrutiny of the car maker's advanced driver-assistance system, known as Autopilot, because the local constable has said that he believed no one was in the driver's seat at the time of the incident. One of the two men who died in the crash in a suburban neighborhood north of Houston was found in the front passenger's seat, the other in the back seat, local officials have said.  Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said Monday that data recovered so far showed Autopilot wasn't enabled. He didn't specify whether that meant at the time of the crash or at any time during the preceding drive. Tesla didn't respond to requests seeking clarification.  NHTSA said that it had received the letter and would review it.  Rep. Kevin Brady (R., Texas), who represents the area where the crash took place, on Thursday joined the growing chorus of lawmakers seeking more information.  ""I support progress that's being made and the development of new technologies for autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles, but we need answers to what happened,"" Mr. Brady, the top Republican member on the House Ways and Means Committee, said on a call with reporters.  Another federal organization, the National Transportation Safety Board, also has launched an investigation into the incident. The board, which has the power to issue safety recommendations, has said its review will focus on both the operation of the vehicle and the post-crash fire, which local officials have said took hours to extinguish. Batteries used in electric vehicles can reignite after initial flames are put out, as this one did, said Palmer Buck, chief of The Woodlands Fire Department, which responded to the incident.  The senators' letter speaks to a tension that regulators face with driver-assistance features such as collision warning or adaptive cruise control. The technology can help make driving safer but introduces new risks.  Tesla says that driving with Autopilot enabled is safer than driving without it. Hours before the Saturday crash, Mr. Musk tweeted: ""Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle.""  NHTSA doesn't have any rules in place specifying how companies must go about ensuring that drivers are paying attention while driver-assistance systems are engaged. The NTSB has said that lack of regulation puts people at risk.  The Texas crash has left questions about whether or how the vehicle could have been operating without anyone in the driver's seat.  Tesla has said that drivers using Autopilot must remain attentive with their hands on the wheel and that it has safety features, including aural and visual alerts, to remind them to stay engaged.  Consumer Reports on Thursday said it had done tests this week in which it was able to get a different Tesla model's Autopilot to operate without anyone in the driver's seat. The vehicle didn't send any warnings about an empty driver's seat, Consumer Reports said.  Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on the Consumer Reports finding.   CO 	 teslmi : Tesla, Inc.

"Document J000000020210407eh470000b",NA,"Artificial Intelligence (A Special Report) --- Mental Roadblocks to Driverless Cars","By Iyad Rahwan and Azim Shariff","906 words","7 April 2021","The Wall Street Journal","J",NA,"R1",NA,"English","Copyright 2021 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.","As we get ever closer to the era of driverless cars, a key question looms: How safe should autonomous vehicles be before we allow them on the road in large numbers?  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recently disclosed that it has opened 27 investigations into crashes of Tesla vehicles, and that four have been completed. Some of those investigations are related to the company's Autopilot driver-assistance system. Tesla didn't respond to requests for comment for this article.","Although AV technology promises numerous benefits, concerns over safety and trust have become the defining issue. The industry recognizes this. ""People are ready to embrace new vehicle technology, especially if it will make driving safer,"" said Greg Brannon, AAA's director of automotive engineering and industry relations, upon the release of results from its latest public-opinion survey in February. As the technology improves, AVs promise extraordinary safety benefits. A 90% reduction in traffic fatalities -- cited in a 2015 report from McKinsey -- is the most frequently repeated figure.  But these promises are many years, if not decades, from being realized. The challenging part is how to get from here to there. A reasonable timeline for when AVs should be rolled out en masse is when they are at least as safe as the average driver. Then not only would we reap their economic and social benefits, but we would also be saving lives. And importantly, we would rapidly begin to accumulate the data needed to drive AV safety levels up even further.  Unfortunately, the broad acceptance of just-better-than-average AVs may be undermined by a host of psychological biases in the minds of consumers. We investigated two of these biases in an article we published on March 15. We asked a representative group of Americans how much safer AVs would have to be, compared with human drivers, for them to be willing to ride in such cars.  If AVs were to eliminate 10% of today's accidents, thus being substantially safer than the average human, only 11% of people would be willing to adopt them. Even if AVs caused accidents at half the rate of human drivers, only 37% of Americans would opt in. To make matters worse, about 15% of people would need AVs to have a perfect safety record before they opt in. What might cause such inflated safety demands from AVs? We identify two primary reasons.  First, there's overconfidence. In our study, the majority of respondents thought if everyone drove as they did, 66% of accidents would be eliminated. And the higher people rated their own driving safety, the safer they wanted AVs to be before they were willing to adopt them.  In addition, we found evidence for a phenomenon called ""algorithm aversion."" It refers to the reluctance of humans to use superior but imperfect algorithms. Our study participants showed more aversion to riding with AVs than to riding with a human driver, even if these two modes of transportation were equally safe.  Is there anything we can do to reduce people's excessive expectations for AV safety? We tried a de-biasing technique designed to help people recognize their tendency to inflate their own driving skills. Interestingly, this intervention succeeded in reducing people's assessment of their own driving skills, though not completely: People now only thought they were, on average, in the 60th percentile of drivers. Unfortunately, however, they didn't budge when it came to how safe they wanted AVs to be. This suggests that people's safety requirements for AVs may be particularly sticky, and more research is needed to find ways to calibrate them.  This leaves decisions about safety thresholds for AVs in a difficult spot. A 2017 Rand Corp.studyillustrated the consequences of an excessive safety threshold by simulating 500 possible future scenarios. In almost all scenarios, if we wait for AVs to be 90% (rather than 10%) safer than the average human driver, we risk failing to save thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of lives in the long term that could be lost while we perfect AV technology.  However, what we show is that if regulators were to allow the broad deployment of 10%-safer AVs, psychological biases could interfere with large-scale adoption and thus prove to be a substantial public health hazard insofar as they prolong the era of relatively dangerous human driving.  Focusing the discussion too much on safety may be one of the problems.Before the pandemic, the average American spent over 52 minutes a day commuting -- time psychologists have found is the least happy part of their day. AVs promise to give us that time back -- for working, for sleeping, for all sorts of activities. While safety should always be the priority of the AV industry, perhaps the communication about AVs should focus more on these other benefits.  ---  Dr. Rahwan is a director of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin.

"Document J000000020210120eh1k0001u",NA,"VW Struggles To Catch Tesla --- German auto maker's $50 billion bet on electric vehicles hits software speed bump","By William Boston","2122 words","20 January 2021","The Wall Street Journal","J",NA,"A1",NA,"English","Copyright 2021 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.","ZWICKAU, Germany -- Five years and nearly $50 billion into the auto industry's biggest bet on electric vehicles, Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess and his guest, Chancellor Angela Merkel, stood in anticipation as the first ID.3, Germany's long-awaited answer to Tesla, rolled off the assembly line.  The event at the company's flagship EV plant just over a year ago marked a ""systemic shift from the combustion engine to the electric vehicle,"" said Thomas Ulbrich, leader of the ID.3 effort.","The car, however, didn't work as advertised.  It could drive, turn corners and stop on a dime. But the fancy technology features VW had promised were either absent or broken. The company's programmers hadn't yet figured out how to update the car's software remotely. Its futuristic head-up display that was supposed to flash speed, directions and other data onto the windshield didn't function. Early owners began reporting hundreds of other software bugs.  After years of development, Volkswagen decided in June last year to delay the launch and sell the first batch of cars without a full array of software, pending a future update, which is now scheduled for mid-February. Tens of thousands of ID.3 owners will have to bring their cars in for service to have the new software installed.  ""After that the software will be regularly updated over the air,"" Mr. Ulbrich said in an interview.  Volkswagen, the world's largest car maker, has outspent all rivals in a global bid by auto incumbents to beat Tesla. For years, industry leaders and analysts pointed to the German company as evidence that, once unleashed, the old guard's raw financial power paired with decades of engineering excellence would make short work of Elon Musk's scrappy startup.  What they didn't consider: Electric vehicles are more about software than hardware. And producing exquisitely engineered gas-powered cars doesn't translate into coding savvy.  The ID.3 debacle is raising the temperature at Volkswagen. Mr. Diess nearly lost his job last year amid a revolt of Germany's powerful IG Metall labor union and shareholder anger over the botched launch of the Golf-8, the VW brand's breadwinner, and the bungled launch of the ID.3. He was stripped of his leadership of the VW brand, VW's biggest business, but kept on as CEO of the entire company without day-to-day operational responsibility.  The ID.3 is gaining traction, outselling Tesla's Model 3 in Europe in December, according to Jato Dynamics, with sales fueled by a price tag that is about $12,000 less than Tesla's model, and by Germany's decision last year to increase incentives for EV purchases. The ID.3 has also garnered negative trade-press reviews and is still missing key features.  Ever since Tesla launched its first car in 2008 ""there was this feeling that the really serious players are going to come,"" said Peter Rawlinson, CEO of electric car startup Lucid Technologies and the former chief engineer of Tesla's Model S. Now, he says, ""the Germans have finally come, and they're not as good as Tesla.""  Other legacy car manufacturers including General Motors, Ford, Renault, Peugeot and Toyota are bringing new electric models to market this year. Failure to keep up could redraw the global auto map, costing German car makers -- Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler -- their leadership status in high-end products.  Mr. Diess is drawing lessons from the mistakes on the ID.3 project as he overhauls the company's software effort to prepare for a successor model, dubbed ID.4, which goes on sale in the U.S. later this year and will be produced at first in Europe and China and next year in Chattanooga, Tenn., as well. VW says the ID.4, its first all-electric car to be sold world-wide, will deliver on its predecessor's promises.  ""In order to be successful in this new world and secure the prosperity of many people . . . VW must completely change,"" Mr. Diess wrote in a recent LinkedIn post.  When Mr. Diess, then head of the VW brand, launched his first EV effort five years ago, he asked Fredmund Malik, an Austrian economist, to hold a ""syntegration workshop"" for senior brand executives. The goal, Prof. Malik said, was to persuade managers lulled into complacency by their company's high profitability that Tesla represented an existential threat.  A second workshop was held a month later, after VW was exposed for cheating on diesel emissions. Mr. Diess wanted to use the jolt of the crisis to overcome internal opposition to electric vehicles, Prof. Malik said. It was at this meeting that VW decided to build what would become the ID.3, complete with custom software to run the vehicle and in-car apps.  Software has been running in gas-powered cars for years. An average passenger vehicle typically includes about 80 parts fitted with chips that perform discrete tasks. These chips run code that remains static over a car's lifetime.  With the shift to electric, computing has become the heart of the vehicle, with a central processor managing the battery, running the electric motors, brakes, lights and other critical systems as well as additional features such as entertainment or heating in the seats. Just like a gas-powered car should be serviced regularly, a modern electric vehicle may receive software updates to improve safety and performance, offer new in-car services, or unlock sources of revenue for the manufacturer.  ""The key here is taking this distributed system in the car, dozens if not hundreds of applications, and centralizing everything,"" says Danny Shapiro, senior director of automotive at Nvidia Corp., the graphics chip maker that has become a player in self-driving car technology. ""This is very complex, especially with a car where the safety level is critical. You can't just flip a switch and be a software company.""  In the early years of the ID.3 effort, the task to code software for the car was scattered across the organization. VW's appointment of Christian Senger, previously head of digital services and electric mobility products, as leader of VW's entire software development, came only in 2019, months before the vehicle's planned launch.  The group's first task was to create a coherent organization out of the thousands of programmers spread around the group and begin to shift critical development in-house. The first major project was VW.os, an operating system for ICAS1, the car's central computer that could be updated remotely.  Another source of complexity was that VW picked different vendors to develop different parts of its software ecosystem. To build its industrial cloud for factories, VW teamed up with Amazon Web Services. For the automotive cloud connecting its cars, it joined with Microsoft Corp. And to build ICAS1, VW turned to Continental AG, the lead partner in a team of 19 suppliers working on developing the system.  Typically, car makers order finished components from suppliers and install them in the vehicle on the assembly line. But the software for a connected car is never finished. Like an iPhone, it is constantly evolving and requires the supplier and customer to work interactively, something that VW and Continental first had to learn as the ICAS project was under way.  VW and its suppliers had to adopt new ways of working together to build the ICAS and connect the ID.3 to the cloud. They created integrated teams that met in workshops at regular intervals to assess the state of play and plot out the next steps. During these workshops, VW often placed new demands on the group as its requirements of the ID.3 evolved, Mr. Ulbrich said.  ""The iPhone today is not the same product it was in the beginning. It has evolved, it is an evolutionary process. And that is the process that VW is going through now,"" Mr. Ulbrich said.  The experience convinced Mr. Diess that he needed to reboot VW's software business. In April, he brought back Prof. Malik for a three-day workshop with about 40 of his top executives. Prof. Malik said Mr. Diess posed a simple question for the group: What do we have to do to catch up with Tesla by 2024?  The CEO opened the gathering with a blistering critique of VW's progress. He showed a slide comparing the ID.3 to the Tesla Model 3, pointing out that while VW's car excelled in old-world features such as spaciousness and design, Tesla beat VW hands down on such metrics as battery range and advanced computing.  At the end of the workshop, the management team had the outlines of a reboot. It would produce a new fully electric and largely self-driving car by 2025, shift more resources from the company's old business to EVs and digitization, expand battery manufacturing, and explore new revenue streams and payment systems.  As the summer 2020 launch date for the ID.3 approached, VW told Continental to focus on critical functions. By then, Mr. Ulbrich and senior VW executives concluded that the ID.3's remote updates weren't yet secure enough to go on the road, Mr. Ulbrich said. The updates not only changed apps and kept the navigation up-to-date, they also made changes to core functions such as the electric powertrain.  ""In mid-2020 we had to make the decision that we would have to ask the first 50,000 vehicles to come to the service stations for an update,"" Mr. Ulbrich said. ""Updating the vehicle's core software is a complex process and we have to make sure at any time that our vehicles are safe.""  VW didn't make Mr. Senger available for comment.  Karsten Michels, the senior Continental engineer working on the project, said the main problem was the teams simply ran out of time. ""Maybe we underestimated how much work is involved and how little we could actually rely on existing legacy software,"" Mr. Michels said in an interview.  Mr. Diess restructured the software development teams. He tapped Audi CEO Markus Duesmann, poached earlier from BMW, to be VW's new software czar.  Mr. Diess also reached outside VW for help. He asked Dirk Hilgenberg, a BMW executive and IT specialist focused on tech turnarounds, if he would replace Mr. Senger as head of the software division.  Mr. Hilgenberg said he had no hesitation. He had spent 28 years at BMW and his track record most recently included turning around production of BMW's X-series SUV in Spartanburg, SC. In recent years, however, he said he had become frustrated by the Munich-based auto maker's reluctance to dive headlong into electric cars.  BMW declined to comment.  ""I'd been watching what Diess was doing in terms of turnaround at VW,"" he said. ""I really liked it because it was decisive, bold, consistent. I've seen nothing in the auto industry that even comes close to that.""  Mr. Hilgenberg's first day at VW was August 1 and he immediately started work on fixing VW.os. The first version, 1.0, is a blend of open source software and custom code by Continental and VW. To fix the current glitches, VW said it would publish an update of the software, version 1.1, in February. A more advanced version -- VW.os 2.0 -- is targeted for 2024 and will include advanced self-driving car features.  VW's goal is to eventually build at least 60% of automotive software in-house.  The biggest challenge, said Mr. Hilgenberg, isn't the technology, it is the mind-set of the people -- their reluctance to embrace radical change until circumstances force them to.  ""In the middle of success it's not easy to understand why you need to change now,"" he says.  Another component of the reboot was the Artemis project, a new in-house design team that would take the software developed by Mr. Hilgenberg's group and integrate it in a new electric, self-driving, and internet-connected vehicle within three years.  ""We fairly quickly came to the conclusion that we needed a separate unit and needed to give it the freedom to develop, a bit like a rocket,"" said Alexander Hitzinger, a Porsche and Apple veteran who presented the idea to the meeting.  Change is coming, Mr. Diess wrote on his LinkedIn page, and VW must move faster. ""The global transformation of the industry will take roughly 10 years,"" he wrote. ""With or without Volkswagen.""

"Document J000000020201228egcs0000o",NA,"Business News: Hands-Free Driving Accelerates --- More vehicles have automated features, raising questions about driver distraction","By Mike Colias","1036 words","28 December 2020","The Wall Street Journal","J",NA,"B3",NA,"English","Copyright 2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.","Auto makers are starting to sell cars with automated steering and speed control to ease what they say is the tedium of driving, and might even allow drivers to go hands-free in some situations.  Those features are raising new questions: How to keep people from getting distracted behind the wheel -- or picking up their phones -- if there is little for their hands to do?","Car companies have been adding safety technologies aimed at preventing crashes, such as automatic emergency braking and systems to prevent the car from drifting out of its lane. Now, more are introducing vehicle features that aim to make driving in rush-hour traffic or on road trips less taxing.  Some new systems allow drivers to take their hands off the wheel on highways or in heavy congestion, using sensors, radar and cameras to automatically keep the car centered, control speed and even to change lanes.  General Motors Co. was the first major car company to promote such capabilities in 2017 with its hands-free Super Cruise feature, which can be activated on most U.S. highways by pushing a button on the steering wheel that enables the car to take over steering and speed control.  The Detroit auto maker said it now plans to roll out the technology on about two dozen models by 2023, up from one Cadillac model now.  Ford Motor Co. said it would offer similar technology beginning next year on as many as 100,000 F-150 pickup trucks and Mustang Mach-E electric sport-utility models.  Honda Motor Co. plans to roll out a sedan in Japan in coming months that will allow the driver to fully cede control of the car in heavy traffic or on highways. The technology will even allow drivers to take their eyes off the road, although they will be expected to take back control at any point, the company said. Japan's government regulators in November approved its use.  Honda said it hasn't revealed plans to introduce this technology beyond Japan.  Meanwhile, Tesla Inc. said it recently released to some owners a test version of its upgraded Autopilot, the auto maker's driver-assistance feature. The $10,000 feature, which the company calls Full Self Driving, expands the use of automated features to more types of roadways and adds capabilities like navigating highway interchanges.  The promise of fully driverless cars has faded in the past few years, as developers struggle to refine the technology. But auto makers are equipping more models with the building blocks of driverless cars to offer so-called driver-assistance packages, hoping to gain a competitive edge and boost sales.  ""They allow auto makers to offer really interesting, differentiated features to the consumer at a reasonable price point,"" said Glen De Vos, chief technology officer of Aptiv PLC, a supplier of software and components used in driver-assistance systems.  Consumer Reports recently tested 17 models that combine automated steering and speed control, up from four when the magazine did a similar test two years ago. The magazine said such systems can ease driver fatigue, but performance varies widely on aspects such as how smoothly they brake and accelerate or keep a car centered in its lane.  Yet if drivers have less to do behind the wheel, safety advocates are concerned they will be tempted to look at their phones or indulge in other distractions, leading to crashes.  ""If we're going to put this technology on cars, we need to be mindful of ensuring the driver is reasonably engaged,"" said Bryan Reimer, a research scientist at M.I.T. who studies driver-assistance systems.  Some advocates have criticized Tesla for promoting its latest update as self-driving because the system isn't fully autonomous, and advocates say a pilot system shouldn't be tested on public roads.  Tesla didn't respond to requests for comment. The electric car maker has previously said accident rates are lower when drivers have vehicles with the Autopilot driver-assistance system engaged than when it isn't in use.  Auto makers have installed camera-based systems that monitor drivers' focus and alert them if their attention is straying, executives and analysts say. GM and BMW AG use the technology to keep drivers engaged, and Ford and others plan to use it in future models. Such systems have drawn praise from researchers.  Aptiv's Mr. De Vos said the company is working with five auto makers to equip vehicles with camera-based driver-tracking systems.  Cadillac owners have logged about 6.5 million hands-free miles using the Super Cruise technology, the company said. A series of audible alerts warn drivers if their attention strays from the road.  Mario Maiorana, chief engineer for GM's Super Cruise, said it has become a selling point for customers, noting that 85% of owners say the feature would be a major consideration in their next car purchase. ""People have told us they feel like they arrive at their destination feeling more refreshed and relaxed because of the work we've handled,"" he said.  A recent update improved the driver-monitoring technology, he said. It can now track the driver's eyes, rather than only the head position, to better detect if the motorist is fixed on the road or elsewhere.  A Senate bill introduced this year would require the Transportation Department to study whether driver-monitoring systems can reduce distracted driving, and potentially require them on future models. The legislation, introduced by Edward Markey (D., Mass.) and Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.) in July, is pending.  A spokesman for the department's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it is researching whether driver-monitoring systems are effective in identifying and mitigating inattentive or impaired drivers.  The growing availability of driver-assistance systems has led to a hodgepodge of different features that vary by model and auto maker, said Kelly Funkhouser, a vehicle-testing manager who leads coverage of automated vehicles at Consumer Reports.  ""These systems all behave so differently and there are no standards for performance or design,"" she said. ""There needs to be more cohesion.""

"Document J000000020201203egc30000a",NA,"Driverless Cars Are Coming, but Won't Take Over --- Autonomous taxi projects start to remove backup drivers, an important but very early milestone","By Stephen Wilmot","780 words","3 December 2020","The Wall Street Journal","J",NA,"B11",NA,"English","Copyright 2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.","[Financial Analysis and Commentary]  Driverless cars are moving out of science fiction and onto U.S. roads. But this is just the start of a long journey before the vehicles fulfill their transformative potential.","Signs of very early-stage commercialization are emerging from the corporate science projects that want to remove human drivers from vehicles. Alphabet's Waymo seems furthest ahead with its ""robotaxi"" project in the suburbs of Phoenix. Customers used to have to sign a nondisclosure agreement to hail a ride with no backup driver, but Waymo opened the service up in October.  Others aren't far behind. Motional, a $4 billion joint venture between South Korean car giant Hyundai and automotive supplier Aptiv, said last month that it will take safety drivers out of its test vehicles in Nevada ""in the coming months."" Cruise Automation, the driverless-car business controlled by General Motors, has said it would remove backup drivers from its test cars in California by year-end.  Doing without safety drivers is an important milestone, but there are plenty more.  Once companies have worked out how to operate robotaxis safely in one urban district in good weather, they will need to adapt to new areas and a wider range of conditions.  Eventually, this kind of gradual expansion should give driverless cars the scale necessary to drive down costs and compete with human-driven taxis, public transport and, in the very long run, car ownership.  Such lofty end goals hint at the huge business opportunities and threats that have drawn tech giants, the auto industry and ""mobility"" providers such as Uber all into the race. For a technology that needs the highest safety standards to secure regulatory and public support, though, the rollout will take years, all the while consuming billions of dollars in capital.  Karl Iagnemma, chief executive of Motional, pegs the price of an entry ticket into the driverless-car contest at roughly $1 billion. That buys the necessary teams, components development and a test fleet, among other startup costs. Much more will be needed to roll out customer-ready fleets on a commercial scale.  One response to this funding challenge has been partnerships. Honda and SoftBank have bought minority stakes in GM's Cruise Automation. Ford and Volkswagen are together fielding another challenger, Argo AI. Even Waymo has raised venture capital from outside Alphabet this year.  The other big tech company involved is Amazon. Last year it took a small stake in Aurora Innovation, the biggest independent driverless-car startup, which is in talks to take over Uber's operation, according to a TechCrunch report. This summer Amazon paid $1.3 billion for Aurora's cash-strapped rival Zoox.  The e-commerce company's move highlights the case for driverless goods transport, which has grown louder during this year's pandemic. Larry Burns, a former GM executive who advises Waymo, expects the commercialization of driverless technology to be driven by freight rather than taxis, partly because logistics is all about operating costs and stands to benefit more directly from removing drivers. Waymo, which was previously laser-focused on robotaxis, in October announced a partnership with Daimler Trucks, the largest maker of big rigs.  Then there is Tesla, which at last year's ""autonomy day"" pledged to have one million robotaxis on the road by the end of 2020. Elon Musk walked back that promise in April and said it might happen next year. The plan is vague, and it is hard to see luxury sedans as the best foundation for a mass ride-hailing operation.  For investors, the question isn't just how far driverless cars are along the road to commercial viability, but how stoked markets are. After much excitement in 2016 and 2017 about their potential to shake up transportation, a fatal crash involving an Uber testing vehicle in 2018 acted as a sobering reminder that the technology couldn't be hurried.  The removal of safety drivers, assuming it doesn't trigger more crashes, could start to revive hopes.  Although most driverless-car ventures are, for good reason, part of larger groups supported by other cash flows, it doesn't seem a bad time to invest in companies with a meaningful stake in their success, such as Aptiv. The total addressable markets are too vast and the disruption story too seductive to ignore.  As the hype rebuilds, just remember: Getting driverless taxis to work in a sunny suburb in Arizona doesn't mean they are on the cusp of taking over the world.

"Document J000000020200609eg690002a",NA,"Volkswagen Cuts CEO's Responsibility --- After missteps with car launches, Diess will no longer lead namesake brand","By William Boston","661 words","9 June 2020","The Wall Street Journal","J",NA,"B1",NA,"English","Copyright 2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.","BERLIN -- Volkswagen AG is shuffling the management of its namesake VW brand in a response to the botched launch of the latest Golf, the company's top-selling model, and persistent troubles readying the new all-electric ID-3 set to go on sale this summer.  The company said Monday that Herbert Diess, chief executive of the Volkswagen company that includes the VW, Audi, Porsche, Lamborghini and Bentley brands, would give up his role as chief of the VW brand. Ralf Brandstatter, currently No. 2 at the VW brand division, will become CEO of the division on July 1 while Mr. Diess will focus on steering the group.","Mr. Diess, a former BMW AG executive who joined VW in 2015 and became CEO of the entire Volkswagen company in 2018 in addition to his role as CEO of the brand, ""will now have more freedom for his tasks as group chief,"" Volkswagen said.  The move, which could weaken Mr. Diess's influence over the day-to-day operations of Volkswagen's largest single division, comes after he faced mounting criticism from labor leaders, who have 10 seats on the 20-person board of directors, in recent weeks.  Mr. Diess's job as CEO doesn't appear to be threatened, but people familiar with the situation said he needs to improve his frosty relationship with top labor leaders and fix problems that have plagued the launches of the company's two most important products.  ""Diess still enjoys the solid backing of the shareholder representatives on the board, but he needs to get VW's problems under control,"" one of the people said.  Mr. Diess has pursued aggressive cost cuts while also making a big bet on electric vehicles in an effort to rebuild the group into the world's leading maker of full-electric cars, overtaking the upstart Tesla Inc.  He has been operating in a brutal environment. Global demand for cars dipped last year and was hit again with the coronavirus pandemic, which also disrupted supply chains, forcing the company to close its plants for weeks.  Last week, Germany adopted a giant 130 billion euros ($146.8 billion) stimulus package but didn't endorse a cash-for-clunkers incentive to encourage the purchase of combustion-engine vehicles -- a setback for the once influential industry, which had been clamoring for the measure.  Volkswagen also has struggled with its ID-3 and the eighth generation of the Golf. The cars have experienced glitches in the complex software needed for driver-assistance features connected to the internet.  Golf sales have been weak and some of the ID-3's basic software features still don't work, causing concern among Volkswagen shareholders and senior labor leaders over the effect on the bottom line.  In addition to the technical snafus, Volkswagen's image suffered after it recently published an embarrassing marketing video on social media aimed at boosting Golf sales, raising questions about managers' judgment. The short film showing a giant white hand pushing aside a black character to let a Golf drive through the frame has drawn criticism of racism and forced the company to apologize and withdraw the ad.  Volkswagen's compliance department is reviewing the incident, which is expected to be discussed at a meeting of the management board under Mr. Diess's leadership on Tuesday, the people familiar with the situation said.  The snowballing of technical troubles and reputational damage facing the company in recent weeks ignited an outcry from labor leaders, who put the issue on the agenda of the May board meeting.  The confrontation at the board meeting came after the company's union shop stewards published an open letter criticizing Mr. Diess and management for what they saw as the failed launch of the Golf and troubles with the company's electric-vehicle development, which they said threatened jobs.

It's No Pipe Dream","By Dan Neil","1331 words","28 March 2020","The Wall Street Journal","J",NA,"D13",NA,"English","Copyright 2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.","39. Have you seen the video of the guy sound asleep at the wheel of his auto-piloted Tesla Model S? Mile after mile, with his head back, mouth open like he's having his teeth cleaned. I envy him.  I've never been able to sleep in a moving motor vehicle -- far as I can tell, no one really does. ""It depends on your definition of sleep,"" wrote Dr. Robert Pascuzzi, Chair of Neurology at Indiana University School of Medicine. ""Not all sleep is the same and if you can't get slow-wave sleep then it's basically sleep deprivation.""","And yet, at a time when most jet travel is grounded, our fly-catching friend in the video suggests a fascinating possibility: Vehicle autonomy could give rise to a class of high-speed, long-distance, overnight personal transportation. Such vehicles/services could provide an alternative to continental, internodal air travel, either commercial or civil -- what the Germans would call Schlaffenwagens.  Imagine not seats but berths, with comfy blankets and pillows, blackout shades and ambient active noise canceling. These teardrop-shaped machines (no windshield) would ride on large pneumatic springs, augmented with fully active and dynamic e-suspension, oscillating like an audio speaker to cancel vertical suspension energies. They could afford to be heavier than ordinary cars, with the structure tuned to enhance the mass-damping effect. Mercedes-Benz showed just such a vehicle at the 2015 CES: the F 015, a big steel cloud on wheels.  These vehicles would have to be electric, for many good reasons, the first of which is packaging: A vehicle design allowing occupants to stretch out calls for a flat, open floor plan, typical of EV skateboards. Second is electric propulsion's wins in noise, vibration and harshness. (You say you need the thrum of an IC engine to sleep by? They can artificially generate that for you. Just take your soma, Boomer.) Instead of chasing fleeting experientials like maximal lateral grip and acceleration, the platform engineers would optimize for silence, stillness and fineness. Third, an EV design's inherently low center of gravity would reduce body roll, improving passenger comfort.  Lastly, range: The kind of battery-energy density auto makers are shooting for now -- on the order of 500 Wh per kg -- will make it fairly easy for sleeper cars to cruise at a whispering 200 kmh and have a range 2,000 km. In this age of enlightenment I'm hoping we will have also embraced the metric system.  All of the above is within reach of science and engineering. But our bodies might need an OS upgrade.  ""We don't really know if people can actually sleep in moving cars,"" said Dr. Mikael Ljung Aust, a psychologist and researcher with Volvo Cars Safety Centre in Gothenburg, Sweden. ""They can sleep on trains, and planes, and on ships. . . . They fall asleep all the time in the simulator.""  In 2018 Volvo Cars revealed its 360c, an autonomous concept with four different interior themes, including ""Sleep"" with a lay-flat bed.  But sleeping, Dr. Ljung Aust noted, is a behavior with a staggering diversity in adaptations. To an extent it's the difference between falling asleep -- succumbing to the car's various somatic cues, what Dr. Ljung Aust called the ""sound palette"" of engine drumming, the dull roar of tires, as well as rocking and vibration -- and staying asleep.  ""Of course kinetosis is a big concern,"" said Dr. Ljung Aust. We still don't know precisely why passengers get carsick more than drivers do. Nor does there seem to be any mantra, opiate, wristband or patch to fully turn down sufferers' vestibular response (equilibrium) or the body's sense of moving through space (proprioception).  In my nuts-and-bolts imagining, the solution might involve some sort of hammock, suspended and actively damped in three axes of motion. Dr. Ljung Aust said all kinds of elastified couches have been visualized and prototyped. The deal breaker has always been safety.  ""We expect A.I. and non-A.I. cars will share the road, coexist,"" he said. ""So we cannot compromise on crash safety."" Typically, humans move around in their sleep, some quite a lot. But passengers are safest when sitting with their hip girdle squarely belted into the seat. Part of the reason it's hard to sleep through the night in any moving car is, ironically, the prolonged immobility.  ""We created a sort of restraining blanket for the 360c,"" said Dr. Ljung Aust. The team also tried occupant safety ""leashes."" ""That's going to need a lot more work,"" he said.  ---  40. Snuggle a Robot  Research has proven that a good cuddle can help you drift off. That's why Somnox -- the world's first sleep robot engineered to be spoonable -- comes in handy. Not only does hugging this pet-like cyber-cushion help you relinquish consciousness, Somnox's beating pulse can regulate your breathing to knock you out faster. And the companion app lets you command the 14-inch-long pillow to play a slew of other sounds, including white noise and a handful of lullabies and meditations. Just don't expect a deeper sleep upon that first embrace. It takes your snuggle buddy at least a week to sync to your behaviors and smartly adjust. $500, meetsomnox.com  ---  41. Shut 'Em Up  ""Sound asleep"" takes on new meaning with these Kokoon headphones. Tech-enabled, ultra-light and uniquely sloped -- with active noise cancellation, active white noise and passive noise isolation built in -- they're crafted to wear comfortably in bed. Via EEG brain wave sensors embedded in each can, they detect when you've escaped into dreamland and flip on active white noise to block any commotion that might jolt you awake. $315, kokoon.io  ---  42. Customize Your Cushion  The paralyzing variety of pillows on the market -- from super-soft down to allergen-free latex foam -- is enough to keep you up at night. Enter Pluto Pillow, a new sleep brand that crafts custom bed cushions in 35 variations based on your unique sleep profile. Pluto's algorithm inquires whether you prioritize plushy over supportive, whether you are a side or stomach sleeper and if your head heats up during the night, to help pinpoint your ideal nighttime companion. The height and density of the solid foam core pillow along with the thickness and quantity of the long, silky fibers in the outer casing vary with each design. Test it for 100 risk-free nights to make sure it's just right. $85, plutopillow.com  ---  43. Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star  In 2004, Guinness World Records immortalized the Megastar, a revolutionary device from Japanese engineer and entrepreneur Takayuki Ohira, for its ability to project 5.6 million stars. Made for use at art exhibitions and large-scale events, the Megastar's technology has since been shrunken by Mr. Ohira into the Homestar Flux, a softball-size planetarium that projects a sky on your bedroom ceiling full of 60,000 high-def stars from distances of up to 114 inches. Its galaxies shine brightly thanks to advanced optics, like five-watt warm white LED lights, while the silent disc rotation ensures the Flux fits unobtrusively into a nighttime drowse-off routine. $189, segatoys.space  ---  My Best Sleep Ever  At home, we have kids crawling into bed at all hours. But some of my best nights of sleep have been in the back of my van after an exhausting big wall climb in Yosemite. It's super quiet. No distractions.
